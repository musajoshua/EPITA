<v thomas broussard>Find me.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/10-0
00:00:06.913 --> 00:00:08.433
<v thomas broussard>Once you have this.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/11-0
00:00:08.513 --> 00:00:08.713
<v thomas broussard>6.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/13-0
00:00:09.673 --> 00:00:14.142
<v thomas broussard>Members will generate the most revenues.
How do we do that?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/13-1
00:00:14.142 --> 00:00:19.953
<v thomas broussard>What's the formula to calculate members
revenues, members generated revenues?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/14-0
00:00:22.393 --> 00:00:28.342
<v thomas broussard>We take the bookings.
The bookings is where we have the number</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/14-1
00:00:28.342 --> 00:00:31.553
<v thomas broussard>of slots and what has been booked.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/15-0
00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:39.953
<v thomas broussard>Exactly.
So then what we can do is to filter.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/16-0
00:00:42.113 --> 00:00:44.073
<v thomas broussard>Persons who are not members.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/17-0
00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:49.230
<v thomas broussard>There's actually only one person with who
is not a member.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/17-1
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.713
<v thomas broussard>It's the the member with ID zero.
It's guest, if you remember.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/18-0
00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:58.433
<v thomas broussard>So we filter that that uh member ID and
then.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/19-0
00:01:00.673 --> 00:01:06.531
<v thomas broussard>How do we compute the generated revenue?
We need to join on the facilities to get</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/19-1
00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:10.746
<v thomas broussard>the member cost,
to multiply the member cost by the number</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/19-2
00:01:10.746 --> 00:01:15.390
<v thomas broussard>of slots that we have booked for that
facility from the booking,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/19-3
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.033
<v thomas broussard>and then that gives me.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/20-0
00:01:17.113 --> 00:01:23.105
<v thomas broussard>The revenue for one booking,
then I group by the member ID,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/20-1
00:01:23.105 --> 00:01:29.596
<v thomas broussard>I do the sum and then I should have my
total revenue per member.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/20-2
00:01:29.596 --> 00:01:32.193
<v thomas broussard>Then I organize by counts.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/21-0
00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:37.513
<v thomas broussard>By the computed value descending and then
I have the top.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/22-0
00:01:38.553 --> 00:01:39.153
<v thomas broussard>Easy, no?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/23-0
00:01:42.353 --> 00:01:43.113

00:01:50.113 --> 00:01:50.753
<v thomas broussard>That's fine.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/25-0

00:05:25.513 --> 00:05:26.273
<v thomas broussard>That's OK.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/61-0
00:05:28.193 --> 00:05:29.313

00:05:32.073 --> 00:05:34.953
<v thomas broussard>Let's start to see that.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/63-0
00:05:36.793 --> 00:05:38.313

00:05:40.873 --> 00:05:46.676
<v thomas broussard>So the revenues they are in the the
central place is the booking.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/65-1
00:05:46.676 --> 00:05:51.073

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/67-0
00:05:58.553 --> 00:06:02.759
<v thomas broussard>Notation cross foot. OK,
if I want to have the link between</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/67-1
00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:05.633

00:06:07.553 --> 00:06:13.873
<v thomas broussard>The slots and then the member details we
need to have.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/69-0
00:06:16.473 --> 00:06:23.482
<v thomas broussard>The query over bookings because this is
the central table that allows me to go in</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/69-1
00:06:23.482 --> 00:06:27.073
<v thomas broussard>two directions. So select from bookings B.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/70-0
00:06:28.713 --> 00:06:34.153
<v thomas broussard>What I want to have,
I want to have the bee dot slots.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/71-0
00:06:35.673 --> 00:06:42.539
<v thomas broussard>The ideally what I would like to have is
the sum of slots times the facilities</v>

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:47.233
<v thomas broussard>that we don't have yet,
but the facility member cost.</v>

00:06:51.033 --> 00:06:56.113
<v thomas broussard>I don't remember exactly the syntax.
It's all attached to member cost.</v>

00:06:57.753 --> 00:07:01.193

00:07:24.033 --> 00:07:29.280
<v thomas broussard>Be careful. If you miss that part,
you will have very weird results,</v>

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.755

It has to be clear because it goes very</v>

00:07:34.755 --> 00:07:37.113
<v thomas broussard>fast to do something like this.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/79-0
00:07:40.473 --> 00:07:45.602
<v thomas broussard>It's almost silent. It will fail,
but it's only a functional failure.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/79-1
00:07:45.602 --> 00:07:49.559
<v thomas broussard>It's not a technical failure.
It will return results,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/79-2
00:07:49.559 --> 00:07:53.882
<v thomas broussard>but results which are very bad because of

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/79-3
00:07:53.882 --> 00:07:57.473
<v thomas broussard>We are not talking about the same kind of

00:07:58.313 --> 00:08:02.495

00:08:06.089 --> 00:08:10.271
<v thomas broussard>it can be difficult to troubleshoot why

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/80-3
00:08:10.271 --> 00:08:13.473

<v thomas broussard>What?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/112-0
00:12:05.553 --> 00:12:14.113
<v thomas broussard>Thanks. My query's kind of different.
It's different. Yes, this is what I have.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/113-0
00:12:15.313 --> 00:12:16.953
<v thomas broussard>Ignoring the comments.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/114-0
00:12:22.553 --> 00:12:26.430
<v thomas broussard>Yep, but we are.
You have still computed the wrong,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/114-1
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:31.277
<v thomas broussard>which is good. I didn't. OK, I have it.
But what counts is this,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/114-2
00:12:31.277 --> 00:12:36.943
<v thomas broussard>and it's the formula which is here.
So I was trying to do something also to</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/114-3
00:12:36.943 --> 00:12:37.913
<v thomas broussard>see if I can.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/115-0
00:12:38.753 --> 00:12:42.307
<v thomas broussard>Instead of do this,
be careful because this is not the</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/115-1
00:12:42.307 --> 00:12:47.348
<v thomas broussard>revenue that you have computed here.
This is the revenue rank because here it</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/115-2
00:12:47.348 --> 00:12:50.773
<v thomas broussard>can be a bit ambiguous.
Someone will read the query.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/115-3
00:12:50.773 --> 00:12:55.168
<v thomas broussard>Here we have the impression that this is
the revenue, but it's not.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/115-4
00:12:55.168 --> 00:12:56.913
<v thomas broussard>It's only the revenue rank.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/116-0
00:12:57.673 --> 00:13:02.729
<v thomas broussard>Once you can display this quantity here
in uh as a column of your this something</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/116-1
00:13:02.729 --> 00:13:03.353
<v thomas broussard>like this.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/117-0
00:13:06.113 --> 00:13:14.083
<v thomas broussard>Um, no, no, keep, keep revenue.
Then I'll do of revenue like this. No, no,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/117-1
00:13:14.083 --> 00:13:16.953
<v thomas broussard>no, no, because you cannot.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/118-0
00:13:18.633 --> 00:13:25.900
<v thomas broussard>What is here? What is in the over?
It's here you are having a quantity.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/118-1
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:30.442
<v thomas broussard>What you want to display is this right?
Yes,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/118-2
00:13:30.442 --> 00:13:35.993
<v thomas broussard>but here in the over you are giving not
OK a quantity.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/119-0
00:13:36.273 --> 00:13:40.455
<v thomas broussard>Or dot by something like will this work?
This this is better,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/119-1
00:13:40.455 --> 00:13:45.514
<v thomas broussard>but it would not run because no,
because actually here it does not rely on</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/119-2
00:13:45.514 --> 00:13:48.954
<v thomas broussard>what has been computed before in the
query. Oh OK,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/119-3
00:13:48.954 --> 00:13:51.113
<v thomas broussard>it has to be standalone you see.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/120-0
00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:56.755
<v thomas broussard>So how do I if I you have to repeat in
the I have to repeat the repeat this</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/120-1
00:13:56.755 --> 00:13:59.581
<v thomas broussard>revenue and reference. Yeah, OK,
thank you.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/120-2
00:13:59.581 --> 00:14:04.785
<v thomas broussard>Be careful here because you have a desk
in the middle that will break the query.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/120-3
00:14:04.785 --> 00:14:09.153
<v thomas broussard>So here you have a new desk. Is it?
We want the user to spare that.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/121-0
00:14:09.553 --> 00:14:13.214
<v thomas broussard>That has the highest number.
So the highest number should be the</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/121-1
00:14:13.214 --> 00:14:17.383
<v thomas broussard>lowest round. That's why I used this.
Yeah, I I I know. But here, I mean,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/121-2
00:14:17.383 --> 00:14:20.086
<v thomas broussard>you have some desk in in the middle of
nowhere,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/121-3
00:14:20.086 --> 00:14:24.593
<v thomas broussard>so it should be reintegrated here. OK.
Just your checks, right? Yeah, Yeah. OK.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/122-0
00:14:25.393 --> 00:14:31.032
<v thomas broussard>Thank you. You're welcome. Yes,
let's make the the version with the rank</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/122-1
00:14:31.032 --> 00:14:33.273
<v thomas broussard>because that was the purpose.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/124-0
00:14:42.753 --> 00:14:43.873
<v thomas broussard>Good.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/125-0
00:14:45.313 --> 00:14:50.666
<v thomas broussard>Yeah, and still,
this is not maybe calling the tables of</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/125-1
00:14:50.666 --> 00:14:56.394
<v thomas broussard>the prefix N can we just? Yeah,
for example, like team user,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/125-2
00:14:56.394 --> 00:15:01.090
<v thomas broussard>team customer, team booking.
There's much easier.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/125-3
00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:04.753
<v thomas broussard>So we see the team people know exactly.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/126-0
00:15:05.153 --> 00:15:11.901
<v thomas broussard>Yeah, but here you have 3 tables. Yeah,
but I'm saying instead of having that in</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/126-1
00:15:11.901 --> 00:15:15.984
<v thomas broussard>here B and we just call them probably C
booking,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/126-2
00:15:15.984 --> 00:15:20.233
<v thomas broussard>probably C the T as in three fields. Hi,
you like.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/127-0
00:15:20.633 --> 00:15:25.923
<v thomas broussard>Yeah, if you like, there's no I tried.
Here we are entering into what we call</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/127-1
00:15:25.923 --> 00:15:31.553
<v thomas broussard>the conventions and the conventions are
different from one company to another, so.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/128-0
00:15:32.873 --> 00:15:37.565
<v thomas broussard>It's it's justified of course. Well,
I understand what you say and it could</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/128-1
00:15:37.565 --> 00:15:41.516
<v thomas broussard>match, but maybe not in.
So it depends so much. But for for me,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/128-2
00:15:41.516 --> 00:15:45.961
<v thomas broussard>you do whatever you like. OK,
there's no whenever let's say for example</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/128-3
00:15:45.961 --> 00:15:50.776
<v thomas broussard>you provide the insert free for creating
the table, can we change and put it?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/128-4
00:15:50.776 --> 00:15:52.073
<v thomas broussard>Of course, of course.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/129-0

and I I will not mind. No worries.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/146-0
00:17:38.393 --> 00:17:38.513
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/147-0

00:18:11.113 --> 00:18:18.547
<v thomas broussard>So practically here that could be a query
to see what you who you want to keep</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/151-1

00:18:42.859 --> 00:18:45.920

00:18:51.764 --> 00:18:56.913
<v thomas broussard>something which would generate more
revenue because you see that the top.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/155-0
00:18:57.353 --> 00:19:05.516
<v thomas broussard>uh The top usages maybe should be favored.
So if this guy wants more message,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/155-1
00:19:05.516 --> 00:19:13.993
<v thomas broussard>maybe you should offer more message to
the the top three members regarding that.</v>

00:21:17.553 --> 00:21:21.640
<v thomas broussard>OK guys,
so you have a new database to create and</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/176-1
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:27.608
<v thomas broussard>a new SQL file to load exactly as in the
exam. You will have to do that.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/176-2
00:21:27.608 --> 00:21:32.513
<v thomas broussard>So let's be in autonomy now.
You have the SQL for the dump.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/177-0
00:21:32.873 --> 00:21:40.393
<v thomas broussard>You know normally how to load this on
your system and then on lecture 5.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/178-0
00:21:41.993 --> 00:21:43.793
<v thomas broussard>You have on lecture 5.</v>

00:22:05.433 --> 00:22:11.633
<v thomas broussard>That you can or you still find to extract
all those information OK.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/182-0
00:22:12.993 --> 00:22:13.633
<v thomas broussard>That's it.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/183-0
00:22:15.073 --> 00:22:15.193
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/193-0
00:23:52.473 --> 00:24:04.015
<v thomas broussard>No, no, I'm not. No, no,
because of the expectation. I mean,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/193-1
00:24:04.015 --> 00:24:09.313
<v thomas broussard>it's really good. It's good.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/194-0

<v thomas broussard>OK, I'm not.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/201-0
00:25:54.273 --> 00:26:09.553
<v thomas broussard>We want to.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/202-0
00:26:10.753 --> 00:26:12.073
<v thomas broussard>Was I?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/203-0
00:26:13.953 --> 00:26:14.433
<v thomas broussard>So.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/208-0
00:27:00.193 --> 00:27:04.193
<v thomas broussard>Yeah, that's.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/209-0
00:27:05.273 --> 00:27:07.553

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/210-0
00:27:08.913 --> 00:27:09.033
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/211-0
00:27:11.913 --> 00:27:28.073
<v thomas broussard>I think that.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/212-0
00:27:34.033 --> 00:27:46.273
<v thomas broussard>Thank you.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/214-0
00:28:02.433 --> 00:28:03.073
<v thomas broussard>It's OK.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/215-0
00:28:07.913 --> 00:28:09.873
<v thomas broussard>Is it loading?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/216-0
00:28:14.633 --> 00:28:17.193
<v thomas broussard>What do we do to create a new database?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/217-0
00:28:21.193 --> 00:28:23.993
<v thomas broussard>New North winds.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/218-0
00:28:29.273 --> 00:28:31.633
<v thomas broussard>In the scripts we create a new folder.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/219-0
00:28:33.193 --> 00:28:34.153
<v thomas broussard>North winds.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/220-0
00:28:39.553 --> 00:28:40.993
<v thomas broussard>Let's copy paste.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/221-0
00:28:42.553 --> 00:28:42.673
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/226-0
00:29:10.913 --> 00:29:16.920
<v thomas broussard>OK,
so let's connect to this and to the new</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/226-1
00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:23.473
<v thomas broussard>database and let's execute everything as
great.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/227-0
00:29:25.873 --> 00:29:29.473
<v thomas broussard>It says something about large scripts can
take some time. We don't care.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/228-0
00:29:35.913 --> 00:29:37.953
<v thomas broussard>Includes the values, et cetera.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/230-0
00:29:45.433 --> 00:29:48.233
<v thomas broussard>Normally you should get this at the end.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/231-0
00:29:50.033 --> 00:29:57.033
<v thomas broussard>OK, updated rows 10,400, six 7576.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/232-0
00:30:03.833 --> 00:30:10.272
<v thomas broussard>Then how to start the data extraction?
It's not possible if you don't know the</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/232-1
00:30:10.272 --> 00:30:12.473
<v thomas broussard>database, you cannot guess.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/233-0
00:30:13.833 --> 00:30:17.795
<v thomas broussard>You have to analyze first.
You have to understand how to understand</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/233-1
00:30:17.795 --> 00:30:18.553
<v thomas broussard>the database.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/234-0
00:30:19.633 --> 00:30:20.593
<v thomas broussard>Go on the north winds.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/236-0
00:30:22.233 --> 00:30:23.393
<v thomas broussard>You have a look to the diagram.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/237-0
00:30:25.113 --> 00:30:31.353
<v thomas broussard>You check the notation you prefer for us,
probably to be well.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/238-0
00:30:33.113 --> 00:30:36.273
<v thomas broussard>That's a huge later, yeah.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/239-0
00:30:38.793 --> 00:30:43.633
<v thomas broussard>I'm sorry for you.
You missed a very good lecture, actually.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/240-0
00:30:50.033 --> 00:30:53.096
<v thomas broussard>OK,
so you see that we have way more tables.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/240-1
00:30:53.096 --> 00:30:57.113
<v thomas broussard>This structure is more like what we will
have in the exam.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/241-0
00:30:57.993 --> 00:31:02.178
<v thomas broussard>Like 15, around 15 tables,
different tables. OK,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/241-1
00:31:02.178 --> 00:31:06.789
<v thomas broussard>of course you will have the database
before the exam.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/241-2
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:13.793
<v thomas broussard>During the vacations you will have that.
So you will spend a very nice Christmas.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/242-0
00:31:13.913 --> 00:31:20.949
<v thomas broussard>Thinking at thinking at me and my
database and trying to do select instead</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/242-1
00:31:20.949 --> 00:31:25.827
<v thomas broussard>of being bored by all the the festivities
etcetera.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/242-2
00:31:25.827 --> 00:31:32.113
<v thomas broussard>So on my side I will be working on
databases as well on Christmas.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/243-0
00:31:32.313 --> 00:31:34.313
<v thomas broussard>It's so boring.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/244-0
00:31:35.593 --> 00:31:38.953
<v thomas broussard>I'm joking of course.
So you will have the database.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/244-1
00:31:38.953 --> 00:31:43.708
<v thomas broussard>You will have to load this before the
exam and to train as much as you can</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/244-2
00:31:43.708 --> 00:31:47.131
<v thomas broussard>before the exam.
So normally on the exam day you know</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/244-3
00:31:47.131 --> 00:31:51.379
<v thomas broussard>perfectly the database,
you know the tables, you know the columns,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/244-4
00:31:51.379 --> 00:31:54.993
<v thomas broussard>you know the structure,
how to make the queries or what?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/245-0
00:31:55.153 --> 00:31:59.821
<v thomas broussard>It's possible to be joined, etc.
It should not be a question.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/245-1
00:31:59.821 --> 00:32:05.092
<v thomas broussard>It should have like reflexes. OK,
so here we have a database which is</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/245-2
00:32:05.092 --> 00:32:06.673
<v thomas broussard>composed of products.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/246-0
00:32:08.953 --> 00:32:09.193
<v thomas broussard>Orders.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/247-0
00:32:10.153 --> 00:32:13.273
<v thomas broussard>Customers,
so we understand that it is a retail.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/248-0
00:32:14.713 --> 00:32:18.306
<v thomas broussard>It's a retail company database.
We have employees.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/248-1
00:32:18.306 --> 00:32:22.323
<v thomas broussard>Employees are linked to orders,
orders to other details,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/248-2
00:32:22.323 --> 00:32:26.833
<v thomas broussard>order details to products,
products to categories to suppliers.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/249-0
00:32:27.993 --> 00:32:31.473
<v thomas broussard>We have some customers as well connected
to others.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/250-0
00:32:32.753 --> 00:32:38.513
<v thomas broussard>And we have as well employees connected
to territories, connected to regions, etc.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/251-0
00:32:40.153 --> 00:32:42.948
<v thomas broussard>OK,
so this is all what we have in this</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/251-1
00:32:42.948 --> 00:32:46.233
<v thomas broussard>database.
So now let's see the first question.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/252-0
00:32:50.153 --> 00:32:54.433
<v thomas broussard>First question is the list of customers.
How do we do that? Select.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/253-0
00:32:55.873 --> 00:32:57.633
<v thomas broussard>style from customers.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/254-0
00:32:59.833 --> 00:33:03.193
<v thomas broussard>Mm-hmm. Select stuff from customers.
Very good.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/255-0
00:33:03.833 --> 00:33:08.793
<v thomas broussard>Let's go on here. Let's open a new script.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/256-0
00:33:13.993 --> 00:33:20.324
<v thomas broussard>Something that can be a bit shorter if
you have multiple files is to set your</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/256-1
00:33:20.324 --> 00:33:25.031
<v thomas broussard>database as default.
You can say see here set as default.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/256-2
00:33:25.031 --> 00:33:30.713
<v thomas broussard>So everything that you will connect to
this connection will directly.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/257-0
00:33:30.713 --> 00:33:34.993
<v thomas broussard>He tried to be executed against North.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/258-0
00:33:41.113 --> 00:33:45.113
<v thomas broussard>Very important during the exam,
copy the question.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/259-0
00:33:46.793 --> 00:33:51.505
<v thomas broussard>So that you can know even after what is
going with what.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/259-1
00:33:51.505 --> 00:33:54.233
<v thomas broussard>So this is the list of customers.</v>

00:33:55.793 --> 00:33:59.073
<v thomas broussard>OK, select Star.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/261-0
00:34:00.353 --> 00:34:01.753
<v thomas broussard>From customers.</v>

00:34:05.873 --> 00:34:11.299
<v thomas broussard>This is not a very good query here
because there's no order by. Yes,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/262-1
00:34:11.299 --> 00:34:12.793
<v thomas broussard>you had a question.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/263-0
00:34:14.513 --> 00:34:14.673
<v thomas broussard>Yep.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/264-0
00:34:18.793 --> 00:34:21.793
<v thomas broussard>Yeah, it's.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/265-0
00:34:24.073 --> 00:34:28.625
<v thomas broussard>Yeah, this is what I wanted to say.
Actually,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/265-1
00:34:28.625 --> 00:34:33.969
<v thomas broussard>here we are missing three things.
The column details,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/265-2
00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:37.433
<v thomas broussard>what has to be selected, the order.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/266-0
00:34:38.633 --> 00:34:43.897
<v thomas broussard>Here we have defined arbitrarily on
ourselves what is what should be the</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/266-1
00:34:43.897 --> 00:34:49.089
<v thomas broussard>other and the limits the number of rules
we want to return in the exam.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/266-2
00:34:49.089 --> 00:34:54.353
<v thomas broussard>For each question it will be stated the
column selection, the order and.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/267-0
00:34:54.473 --> 00:35:01.873
<v thomas broussard>The limits the number of rows that is
expected. Yeah.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/268-0
00:35:05.113 --> 00:35:10.073
<v thomas broussard>Yes, this is not. This is too ambiguous.
I agree.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/269-0
00:35:13.153 --> 00:35:13.273
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/271-0
00:35:14.313 --> 00:35:17.319
<v thomas broussard>Yeah,
actually a lot of answers are acceptable</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/271-1
00:35:17.319 --> 00:35:20.198
<v thomas broussard>because the the question is very vague
here.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/271-2
00:35:20.198 --> 00:35:25.443
<v thomas broussard>But in the exam what I wanted to say is
that it will be way more precise plus you</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/271-3
00:35:25.443 --> 00:35:28.578
<v thomas broussard>will have the screenshot of the expected
result.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/271-4
00:35:28.578 --> 00:35:31.073
<v thomas broussard>So normally you cannot miss the target.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/272-0
00:35:31.353 --> 00:35:31.633
<v thomas broussard>Yeah.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/273-0
00:35:34.193 --> 00:35:42.993
<v thomas broussard>Exactly. Yeah. So very,
very interesting notice. Have a look here.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/274-0
00:35:44.553 --> 00:35:48.530
<v thomas broussard>If for instance,
what is important is to have the contact</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/274-1
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:48.873
<v thomas broussard>name.</v>

00:35:50.233 --> 00:35:53.433
<v thomas broussard>K and in the list it is.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/278-0
00:35:55.353 --> 00:35:56.033
<v thomas broussard>Like this.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/279-0
00:36:00.473 --> 00:36:06.664
<v thomas broussard>You cannot cannot have the full mark if
the column name doesn't match exactly</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/279-1
00:36:06.664 --> 00:36:12.300
<v thomas broussard>what is in the screenshot. OK,
but it will be said select contact name</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/279-2
00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:15.793
<v thomas broussard>as it would be said I mean in the
question.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/280-0
00:36:16.513 --> 00:36:23.673
<v thomas broussard>You will have to provide as an output the
column contact name renamed as contact.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/281-0
00:36:24.873 --> 00:36:28.342
<v thomas broussard>OK,
and if it is not stated then you have to</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/281-1
00:36:28.342 --> 00:36:34.048
<v thomas broussard>match the screenshot makes is the ground
truth because I will compare the</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/281-2
00:36:34.048 --> 00:36:40.293
<v thomas broussard>screenshot is actually my my own answer.
OK and so you will have to match my own</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/281-3
00:36:40.293 --> 00:36:40.833
<v thomas broussard>answer.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/282-0
00:36:41.353 --> 00:36:44.510
<v thomas broussard>OK,
so if it is something is not clear in the</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/282-1
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:50.001
<v thomas broussard>statement in the title of the question,
then you can refer to the screenshot to</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/282-2
00:36:50.001 --> 00:36:53.433
<v thomas broussard>match the screenshot.
But normally I paid a very.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/283-0
00:36:54.313 --> 00:37:01.035
<v thomas broussard>Find attention to the statements to the
requirements so that it is clear for you</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/283-1
00:37:01.035 --> 00:37:05.433
<v thomas broussard>the number of different products.
How do we do that?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/284-0
00:37:12.353 --> 00:37:12.833
<v thomas broussard>Select.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/285-0
00:37:20.033 --> 00:37:20.353
<v thomas broussard>Stop.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/286-0
00:37:26.793 --> 00:37:27.473
<v thomas broussard>Like this?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/287-0
00:37:28.793 --> 00:37:32.753
<v thomas broussard>Yeah, can can work. That can work,
but maybe that's not.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/288-0
00:37:35.513 --> 00:37:40.315
<v thomas broussard>Or maybe we should verify something
because here it said number of different</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/288-1
00:37:40.315 --> 00:37:43.370
<v thomas broussard>different products,
not only number of products,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/288-2
00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:47.424
<v thomas broussard>number of different products,
maybe inferring that we could have</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/288-3
00:37:47.424 --> 00:37:50.355
<v thomas broussard>duplicates.
So how can we make sure there's no</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/288-4
00:37:50.355 --> 00:37:51.353
<v thomas broussard>duplicates here?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/289-0
00:37:52.553 --> 00:37:53.993
<v thomas broussard>On the based on the name.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/291-0
00:38:07.673 --> 00:38:12.018
<v thomas broussard>You see just one tip.
Here you see that I do not have any</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/291-1
00:38:12.018 --> 00:38:15.989
<v thomas broussard>completion.
So what I suggest is that you start with</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/291-2
00:38:15.989 --> 00:38:22.058
<v thomas broussard>the from and then you you have completion
based on what you have selected in the</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/291-3
00:38:22.058 --> 00:38:22.433
<v thomas broussard>from.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/292-0
00:38:24.753 --> 00:38:30.786
<v thomas broussard>So in the way you write your queries,
what I would do is to do select from then</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/292-1
00:38:30.786 --> 00:38:34.633
<v thomas broussard>your your table and then what you want to
do with.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/293-0
00:38:37.913 --> 00:38:41.193
<v thomas broussard>That and here we want to identify if
there's.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/294-0
00:38:42.833 --> 00:38:43.913
<v thomas broussard>Still the same number.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/295-0
00:38:46.513 --> 00:38:50.084
<v thomas broussard>Of different product names and actually
this is true. OK,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/295-1
00:38:50.084 --> 00:38:52.793
<v thomas broussard>so there's no duplicate regarding the
name.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/296-0
00:39:01.513 --> 00:39:03.393
<v thomas broussard>The council of employees.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/297-0
00:39:04.753 --> 00:39:04.833
<v thomas broussard>It.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/298-0
00:39:12.593 --> 00:39:13.233
<v thomas broussard>Same.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/299-0
00:39:14.873 --> 00:39:22.753
<v thomas broussard>Same as the what we have in two,
but this time it's from employees.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/300-0
00:39:27.273 --> 00:39:29.793
<v thomas broussard>Then the four I will let you do.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/301-0
00:39:32.353 --> 00:39:39.314
<v thomas broussard>I'll let you think a bit on the form,
not not that you have been warmed up a</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/301-1
00:39:39.314 --> 00:39:45.553
<v thomas broussard>little bit. Think about the form,
where to find the data, where and.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/303-0
00:39:54.793 --> 00:39:55.233
<v thomas broussard>Chip.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/304-0
00:40:00.113 --> 00:40:00.913
<v thomas broussard>Like this?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/305-0
00:40:03.753 --> 00:40:06.473
<v thomas broussard>I will send the file on by the way.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/306-0
00:40:10.113 --> 00:40:10.193
<v thomas broussard>The.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/307-0
00:40:14.793 --> 00:40:17.913
<v thomas broussard>If one comes here, it's not arrived.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/309-0
00:40:30.873 --> 00:40:31.273
<v thomas broussard>Yeah.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/312-0
00:40:51.353 --> 00:40:51.913
<v thomas broussard>Mhm.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/327-0
00:41:59.473 --> 00:42:04.953
<v thomas broussard>So how do we find the information to
compute a revenue?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/328-0
00:42:07.633 --> 00:42:12.375
<v thomas broussard>Let's have a look to database. No,
nothing can be guessed.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/328-1
00:42:12.375 --> 00:42:17.439
<v thomas broussard>You have to to find your.
In other details we have unit price,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/328-2
00:42:17.439 --> 00:42:22.664
<v thomas broussard>quantity and discount.
So normally we should be able to build if</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/328-3
00:42:22.664 --> 00:42:24.513
<v thomas broussard>we sum everything here.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/329-0
00:42:24.993 --> 00:42:31.475
<v thomas broussard>we should be able to to build the total
overall revenue, whatever the dates,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/329-1
00:42:31.475 --> 00:42:37.873
<v thomas broussard>constraints here, we can generate this.
So how do we build the formula now?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/330-0
00:42:38.753 --> 00:42:44.473
<v thomas broussard>So as I said,
we should do select from other details.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/331-0
00:42:46.393 --> 00:42:48.193
<v thomas broussard>And then what's the formula?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/332-0
00:42:50.193 --> 00:42:54.233
<v thomas broussard>It will be a sum, it's true, of what?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/333-0
00:42:55.913 --> 00:42:56.473

00:42:58.113 --> 00:42:59.593
<v thomas broussard>Unit price times.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/335-0
00:43:02.713 --> 00:43:06.633
<v thomas broussard>So this is the the rule price.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/336-0
00:43:09.073 --> 00:43:14.987
<v thomas broussard>We need to subtract the discount which is
a ercentage as well.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/336-1
00:43:14.987 --> 00:43:18.273
<v thomas broussard>O we need to do OD discounts times.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/337-0
00:43:19.153 --> 00:43:27.323
<v thomas broussard>But because I look at the data,
because I looked at the data,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/337-1
00:43:27.323 --> 00:43:36.153
<v thomas broussard>I know I know the database,
but it's it's a good thing to to find.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/338-0
00:43:36.553 --> 00:43:41.313
<v thomas broussard>data,
and we see that the discount is never</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/338-1
00:43:41.313 --> 00:43:48.129
<v thomas broussard>above one. It's .25, .1, .2.
You see that here we have decimal</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/338-2
00:43:48.129 --> 00:43:54.513
<v thomas broussard>rounding issues,
but we have never normally, we have never</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/339-0
00:43:54.593 --> 00:43:57.993
<v thomas broussard>Above one, so it's a percentage.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/340-0
00:43:59.273 --> 00:44:03.835
<v thomas broussard>So it's minus discount times unit price
and quantity.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/340-1
00:44:03.835 --> 00:44:09.750
<v thomas broussard>And normally you are super good at
mathematics, right? Yes. OK, good.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/340-2
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:15.073
<v thomas broussard>So we can optimize a bit.
We can reduce a bit that expression.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/341-0
00:44:18.873 --> 00:44:21.593
<v thomas broussard>Can we reduce a bit that expression?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/342-0
00:44:25.953 --> 00:44:30.993
<v thomas broussard>If I ask the question, the answer is yes,
yes we can.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/343-0
00:44:32.433 --> 00:44:37.033
<v thomas broussard>We can can we reduce this expression
because it's a bit long?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/344-0
00:44:42.713 --> 00:44:43.593
<v thomas broussard>Times.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/345-0
00:44:53.273 --> 00:44:54.233
<v thomas broussard>Like this.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/346-0
00:44:57.873 --> 00:45:01.593
<v thomas broussard>Does that work like this?
The answer is yes.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/347-0
00:45:15.033 --> 00:45:15.513
<v thomas broussard>Thank you.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/348-0
00:45:16.753 --> 00:45:17.713
<v thomas broussard>Works.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/349-0
00:45:21.033 --> 00:45:25.553
<v thomas broussard>Let's see. Huh?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/350-0
00:45:26.513 --> 00:45:31.993
<v thomas broussard>It's changing the value, no?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/351-0
00:45:37.313 --> 00:45:39.793
<v thomas broussard>Maybe what can happen is rounding issues.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/353-0
00:45:54.393 --> 00:45:54.793
<v thomas broussard>Welcome.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/354-0
00:45:55.953 --> 00:45:56.873
<v thomas broussard>That was my only.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/355-0
00:46:04.233 --> 00:46:05.273
<v thomas broussard>Same one.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/356-0
00:46:07.113 --> 00:46:11.154
<v thomas broussard>Hopefully,
but it's true that sometimes you can have</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/356-1
00:46:11.154 --> 00:46:17.406
<v thomas broussard>some some slight difference at the ends
of the decimal due to rounding issues and</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/356-2
00:46:17.406 --> 00:46:23.353
<v thomas broussard>in the way the engine is processing the
values, maybe not in the same orders.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/357-0
00:46:23.753 --> 00:46:24.993
<v thomas broussard>Always.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/358-0
00:46:27.673 --> 00:46:32.221
<v thomas broussard>OK, so this and that are strictly current.
Let's stay.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/358-1
00:46:32.221 --> 00:46:35.033
<v thomas broussard>Let's stay with the short version.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/359-0
00:46:36.713 --> 00:46:38.313
<v thomas broussard>OK guys, understood.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/360-0
00:46:39.633 --> 00:46:40.433
<v thomas broussard>Goods.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/361-0
00:46:42.113 --> 00:46:47.273
<v thomas broussard>A bit harder now,
the total revenue for one specific year.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/362-0
00:46:52.593 --> 00:46:57.513
<v thomas broussard>I'm not sure you are talking about the
question five. Am I wrong?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/365-0
00:47:06.593 --> 00:47:10.153
<v thomas broussard>There's a what?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/366-0
00:47:12.513 --> 00:47:17.115
<v thomas broussard>There's not a revenue table,
but we have just computed here what</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/366-1
00:47:17.115 --> 00:47:18.673
<v thomas broussard>should be the revenue.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/367-0
00:47:19.873 --> 00:47:27.113
<v thomas broussard>And now we need to make it organized per
year.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/368-0
00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:29.753
<v thomas broussard>Yeah.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/370-0
00:47:33.233 --> 00:47:33.633
<v thomas broussard>Yes, because.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/371-0
00:47:35.633 --> 00:47:41.126
<v thomas broussard>We need to join because we do not have
any dates information in orders order</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/371-1
00:47:41.126 --> 00:47:44.621
<v thomas broussard>details.
In order details we have nothing but in</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/371-2
00:47:44.621 --> 00:47:46.833
<v thomas broussard>orders we have the order dates.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/373-0
00:47:53.313 --> 00:47:57.713
<v thomas broussard>Let's have a look from what table should
we fetch?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/374-0
00:47:59.393 --> 00:48:01.873
<v thomas broussard>From order, Are you sure?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/375-0
00:48:05.793 --> 00:48:08.705
<v thomas broussard>So OK,
let me let's let me know about your</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/375-1
00:48:08.705 --> 00:48:11.753
<v thomas broussard>strategy and then I will compare with
yours.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/376-0
00:48:15.433 --> 00:48:15.673
<v thomas broussard>Yeah.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/377-0
00:48:21.233 --> 00:48:27.891
<v thomas broussard>Yes, but we don't need 2 sub selects here.
2 selects we can one with one it works.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/377-1
00:48:27.891 --> 00:48:34.550
<v thomas broussard>It's only that it's true that we need to
join at some point. We need to join what?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/377-2
00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:35.593
<v thomas broussard>What to what?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/378-0
00:48:38.313 --> 00:48:39.353
<v thomas broussard>But from where?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/379-0
00:48:40.593 --> 00:48:44.236
<v thomas broussard>Yes,
we we keep other details as the primary</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/379-1
00:48:44.236 --> 00:48:50.712
<v thomas broussard>table and for each other detail we have
one single order which is very good for</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/379-2
00:48:50.712 --> 00:48:54.355
<v thomas broussard>us because it means that we do not
multiply,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/379-3
00:48:54.355 --> 00:48:57.513
<v thomas broussard>we do not have any combinatory problem.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/380-0
00:48:57.793 --> 00:49:01.875
<v thomas broussard>Remember the problem with if you do the
reverse here,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/380-1
00:49:01.875 --> 00:49:07.922
<v thomas broussard>if you select orders and then you join on
on order details for each order line,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/380-2
00:49:07.922 --> 00:49:13.970
<v thomas broussard>you will create duplicates here because
there are several other details for one</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/380-3
00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:14.953
<v thomas broussard>single order.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/381-0
00:49:16.353 --> 00:49:20.087
<v thomas broussard>What's an order detail?
It's actually the sub,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/381-1
00:49:20.087 --> 00:49:22.153
<v thomas broussard>the component of an order.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/382-0
00:49:23.713 --> 00:49:28.114
<v thomas broussard>So for instance, if you're on Amazon,
you buy three products,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/382-1
00:49:28.114 --> 00:49:33.793
<v thomas broussard>you will have three order details entries
for one big order. You see the point.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/383-0
00:49:35.473 --> 00:49:42.726
<v thomas broussard>Yes, so one order can be projected,
uh can be decomposed,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/383-1
00:49:42.726 --> 00:49:48.353
<v thomas broussard>broke down into three or more order
details.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/384-0
00:49:49.313 --> 00:49:54.780
<v thomas broussard>So that's not good to to fetch from
orders because we will have this problem.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/384-1
00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:59.827
<v thomas broussard>It's visible here, it's multiple.
So the the good thing is to keep with</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/384-2
00:49:59.827 --> 00:50:03.472
<v thomas broussard>other details,
join on on on orders and extract the</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/384-3
00:50:03.472 --> 00:50:04.313
<v thomas broussard>other dates.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/385-0
00:50:04.953 --> 00:50:08.953
<v thomas broussard>If you remember,
we have seen date functions.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/386-0
00:50:10.273 --> 00:50:13.772
<v thomas broussard>Very quickly,
but we have introduced it and among the</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/386-1
00:50:13.772 --> 00:50:17.336
<v thomas broussard>date functions there were there was the
year function.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/386-2
00:50:17.336 --> 00:50:21.872
<v thomas broussard>So the year function will extract only
the year components of a date.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/386-3
00:50:21.872 --> 00:50:26.473
<v thomas broussard>So if you apply year on all the dates,
you will extract only the year.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/387-0
00:50:26.513 --> 00:50:34.500
<v thomas broussard>It's it's not a cast, it's an extraction.
It will return the year as a as a number.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/387-1
00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:39.730
<v thomas broussard>OK, for instance,
here we can have the database or the</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/387-2
00:50:39.730 --> 00:50:42.393
<v thomas broussard>dates are from 1996 to 1998.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/389-0
00:50:42.513 --> 00:50:49.913
<v thomas broussard>So we can have 1996, 1998 or 1990,
1997 and then 1998, OK.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/390-0
00:50:51.633 --> 00:50:55.414
<v thomas broussard>So then you will have to extract for one
specific year,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/390-1
00:50:55.414 --> 00:50:57.913
<v thomas broussard>so with the where clause or with the.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/391-0
00:51:02.433 --> 00:51:07.593
<v thomas broussard>How can we have the revenue per year?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/392-0
00:51:08.953 --> 00:51:09.433
<v thomas broussard>Reserve.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/393-0
00:51:11.233 --> 00:51:11.673
<v thomas broussard>Yes.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/394-0
00:51:14.193 --> 00:51:19.056
<v thomas broussard>With a with a group by, we can have the.
If we group by year,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/394-1
00:51:19.056 --> 00:51:24.233
<v thomas broussard>we'll have not only for one specific year,
but for all the years.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/395-0
00:51:25.313 --> 00:51:31.367
<v thomas broussard>So that's more that that's more
interesting maybe to have this than to</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/395-1
00:51:31.367 --> 00:51:38.019
<v thomas broussard>have a fixed where close with only one
year selected. OK for a specific year,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/395-2
00:51:38.019 --> 00:51:40.833
<v thomas broussard>but you have two ways to do that.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/396-0
00:51:41.153 --> 00:51:46.390
<v thomas broussard>Either you use the group by as an
intermediate and then you do you do a</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/396-1
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:50.318
<v thomas broussard>work close or you have you fix one
specific year. OK,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/396-2
00:51:50.318 --> 00:51:56.210
<v thomas broussard>but the more natural way would be to use
a group by because by advance you don't</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/396-3
00:51:56.210 --> 00:52:00.793
<v thomas broussard>know the range of dates that you can have,
so you cannot have.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/397-0
00:52:00.993 --> 00:52:06.663
<v thomas broussard>You cannot see even what specific year
you would like to to extract because you</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/397-1
00:52:06.663 --> 00:52:11.837
<v thomas broussard>don't know in advance what specific years
you have in this database. OK,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/397-2
00:52:11.837 --> 00:52:17.650
<v thomas broussard>so the most natural way would be to do a
a group by year and then to see what you</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/397-3
00:52:17.650 --> 00:52:18.713
<v thomas broussard>want to select.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/398-0
00:52:19.073 --> 00:52:19.193
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/399-0
00:52:21.033 --> 00:52:26.833
<v thomas broussard>Do one or the other. I don't mind.
Just try.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/403-0
00:52:45.753 --> 00:52:45.793
<v thomas broussard>Oh.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/404-0
00:52:58.673 --> 00:52:58.793
<v thomas broussard>Oh.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/409-0
00:53:24.833 --> 00:53:38.310
<v thomas broussard>You mean in the exam? In the exam, yes,
it would be for year, for instance,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/409-1
00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:40.793
<v thomas broussard>for year 1996.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/410-0
00:53:44.433 --> 00:53:47.673
<v thomas broussard>Yep. Equal. Yeah.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/411-0
00:53:49.113 --> 00:53:49.593
<v thomas broussard>Exactly.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/412-0
00:53:52.433 --> 00:53:59.673
<v thomas broussard>Well, that this is, well, right,
one specific year.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/413-0
00:54:01.273 --> 00:54:04.233
<v thomas broussard>Alright, for all the, yeah, for each year.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/414-0
00:54:06.673 --> 00:54:12.272
<v thomas broussard>But that's no worries about that because
really in the exam it will be like guided</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/414-1
00:54:12.272 --> 00:54:15.443
<v thomas broussard>100%.
You will have normally no question about</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/414-2
00:54:15.443 --> 00:54:20.503
<v thomas broussard>what should be the output because you
will have the output as a as a as an</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/414-3
00:54:20.503 --> 00:54:21.313
<v thomas broussard>example, OK.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/415-0
00:54:25.873 --> 00:54:28.633
<v thomas broussard>Mm-hmm. If there was.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/416-0
00:54:29.633 --> 00:54:33.920
<v thomas broussard>Yes,
but you can use between or the dates</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/416-1
00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:39.227
<v thomas broussard>subtract.
But here I can tell you in the exam there</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/416-2
00:54:39.227 --> 00:54:41.473
<v thomas broussard>will be no date range.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/417-0
00:54:42.353 --> 00:54:47.913
<v thomas broussard>I'm not done yet with the preparation,
but it's not in my my objectives.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/418-0
00:54:48.953 --> 00:54:50.393
<v thomas broussard>OK, so</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/419-0
00:54:52.513 --> 00:54:52.873
<v thomas broussard>Yes.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/420-0
00:54:59.033 --> 00:54:59.513
<v thomas broussard>Mhm.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/421-0
00:55:00.993 --> 00:55:05.524
<v thomas broussard>But not in the group by,
not in the other by, yes,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/421-1
00:55:05.524 --> 00:55:11.388
<v thomas broussard>but not in the group by.
But because this is another computation,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/421-2
00:55:11.388 --> 00:55:11.833
<v thomas broussard>yeah.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/422-0
00:55:13.553 --> 00:55:14.393
<v thomas broussard>Yeah, yeah.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/423-0
00:55:16.113 --> 00:55:20.633
<v thomas broussard>And the group by is is computed before
the select.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/424-0
00:55:21.793 --> 00:55:27.640
<v thomas broussard>uh Same kind of problem, yes.
Yeah So only that the wrong it's not a</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/424-1
00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:31.962
<v thomas broussard>problem,
since you until you want to use it in the</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/424-2
00:55:31.962 --> 00:55:36.793
<v thomas broussard>WHERE clause. Remember it's FROM,
WHERE and then SELECT.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/425-0
00:55:38.153 --> 00:55:41.269
<v thomas broussard>OK,
and the group by is before the where</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/425-1
00:55:41.269 --> 00:55:41.953
<v thomas broussard>actually.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/426-0
00:55:45.073 --> 00:55:48.709
<v thomas broussard>So you will have from group by where and
then select.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/426-1
00:55:48.709 --> 00:55:54.028
<v thomas broussard>So This is why you cannot use what you
have defined in the select in the group</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/426-2
00:55:54.028 --> 00:55:57.529
<v thomas broussard>by because it's something different.
It's not step,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/426-3
00:55:57.529 --> 00:55:59.953
<v thomas broussard>it's not processed at the same time.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/427-0
00:56:02.433 --> 00:56:06.473
<v thomas broussard>It's in the. It's a select function,
so it's at at the end, yeah.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/428-0
00:56:09.033 --> 00:56:09.233
<v thomas broussard>Yeah.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/429-0
00:56:13.833 --> 00:56:16.073
<v thomas broussard>O Let's start with what we have already.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/430-0
00:56:17.993 --> 00:56:19.313
<v thomas broussard>So select.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/431-0
00:56:20.473 --> 00:56:24.054
<v thomas broussard>No, no, no, no.
As revenue from all the details. OK,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/431-1
00:56:24.054 --> 00:56:27.433
<v thomas broussard>so that's the base stuff.
Now we we need to have.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/432-0
00:56:29.113 --> 00:56:38.393
<v thomas broussard>Some dates related elements so we can do
left join orders on.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/433-0
00:56:43.113 --> 00:56:49.276
<v thomas broussard>Be very careful here to match the exact
same concept. If you don't,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/433-1
00:56:49.276 --> 00:56:52.993
<v thomas broussard>then you will have unpredictable results.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/434-0
00:56:54.993 --> 00:56:59.913
<v thomas broussard>Left join orders on that condition.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/435-0
00:57:02.553 --> 00:57:09.471
<v thomas broussard>And then we want to let's use the group
by fashion group by year of four dots for</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/435-1
00:57:09.471 --> 00:57:12.593
<v thomas broussard>the dates. Pay attention now because.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/436-0
00:57:15.913 --> 00:57:21.608
<v thomas broussard>The revenue you don't know if it is
linked to the order date or to the</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/436-1
00:57:21.608 --> 00:57:26.020
<v thomas broussard>shipped date,
which can be different because there can</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/436-2
00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:30.593
<v thomas broussard>be a difference between the order dates
and the shipped.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/437-0
00:57:30.833 --> 00:57:32.073
<v thomas broussard>The shipment date.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/438-0
00:57:33.993 --> 00:57:38.299
<v thomas broussard>If you have a shipment date which is in
the next year,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/438-1
00:57:38.299 --> 00:57:44.406
<v thomas broussard>it can change a lot your computation,
so be careful how to know that you have</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/438-2
00:57:44.406 --> 00:57:48.086
<v thomas broussard>to ask.
You have to ask to the business domain</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/438-3
00:57:48.086 --> 00:57:48.713
<v thomas broussard>experts.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/439-0
00:57:50.193 --> 00:57:54.317
<v thomas broussard>We grou by that,
so if we grou by that then it means that</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/439-1
00:57:54.317 --> 00:57:57.873
<v thomas broussard>we need to put it in the column in the
row title.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/440-0
00:58:00.473 --> 00:58:03.273
<v thomas broussard>And then we can order by.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/441-0
00:58:08.793 --> 00:58:09.033
<v thomas broussard>Yeah.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/442-0
00:58:14.593 --> 00:58:20.548
<v thomas broussard>Here the other by I can use the year that
I've defined here because the other by is</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/442-1
00:58:20.548 --> 00:58:21.753
<v thomas broussard>after the select.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/443-0
00:58:24.633 --> 00:58:28.393
<v thomas broussard>So this is the breakdown of the overall
revenue per year.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/444-0
00:58:29.593 --> 00:58:36.289
<v thomas broussard>So at least now I know that there's 1996.
I could have used another strategy as</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/444-1
00:58:36.289 --> 00:58:38.633
<v thomas broussard>well to say select distinct.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/445-0
00:58:43.993 --> 00:58:44.553
<v thomas broussard>Yeah.</v>

00:58:55.833 --> 00:59:00.138
<v thomas broussard>And here it gives me only the different
years. OK,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/448-1
00:59:00.138 --> 00:59:05.879
<v thomas broussard>you see that there's a very close
relationship between group by and</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/448-2
00:59:05.879 --> 00:59:10.100
<v thomas broussard>distinct,
because if you notice what we have here</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/448-3
00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:11.873
<v thomas broussard>is nothing more than.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/449-0
00:59:12.393 --> 00:59:17.761
<v thomas broussard>Nothing different from what we have in
the distinct. Why is that?</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/449-1
00:59:17.761 --> 00:59:24.431
<v thomas broussard>Because we use the same key to group here.
We use those unique values in order to</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/449-2
00:59:24.431 --> 00:59:26.953
<v thomas broussard>group the values by those keys.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/450-0
00:59:28.073 --> 00:59:32.961
<v thomas broussard>So if you want to have only,
let's say the column type, the row titles,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/450-1
00:59:32.961 --> 00:59:35.473
<v thomas broussard>you can use a distinct with the same.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/451-0
00:59:36.473 --> 00:59:42.633
<v thomas broussard>Arguments as the group by and you will
have the only the unique values.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/452-0
00:59:44.313 --> 00:59:44.713
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/453-0
00:59:47.633 --> 00:59:49.793
<v thomas broussard>Now if you want to have.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/457-0
01:00:13.313 --> 01:00:13.433
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/458-0
01:00:18.353 --> 01:00:24.169
<v thomas broussard>This is for one specific year.
This is the list of the different years</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/458-1
01:00:24.169 --> 01:00:26.873
<v thomas broussard>and this is the revenue per year.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/459-0
01:00:28.593 --> 01:00:29.953
<v thomas broussard>So difference.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/460-0
01:00:30.993 --> 01:00:32.633
<v thomas broussard>Ways to reach the same results.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/462-0
01:00:34.233 --> 01:00:39.517
<v thomas broussard>The only thing is that this one is way
more portable because you can reuse.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/462-1
01:00:39.517 --> 01:00:42.993
<v thomas broussard>Of course,
if you need to move from 1996 to 1997,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/462-2
01:00:42.993 --> 01:00:45.913
<v thomas broussard>you don't have to rewrite the whole query.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/463-0
01:00:45.953 --> 01:00:46.793
<v thomas broussard>Very good.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/464-0
01:00:51.833 --> 01:00:54.710
<v thomas broussard>OK, guys,
let's do the attendance and we will be</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/464-1
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:59.114
<v thomas broussard>done for today. Next time what we will do,
we'll continue that set of data</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/464-2
01:00:59.114 --> 01:01:02.696
<v thomas broussard>extractions a bit on the same format.
You work a little bit.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/464-3
01:01:02.696 --> 01:01:06.513
<v thomas broussard>I'm proposing a solution.
You ask me questions, we will discuss.</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/465-0
01:01:06.553 --> 01:01:12.113
<v thomas broussard>And we move to the next question so that
I think doing that you will practice,</v>

b9523a45-10e2-4949-87bc-3b9d9ffa8240/465-1
01:01:12.113 --> 01:01:17.673
<v thomas broussard>you will be more prepared and you will
reach the the level I want you to have.</v>
