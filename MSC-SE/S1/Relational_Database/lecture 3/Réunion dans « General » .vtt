<v thomas broussard>That's.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/18-0
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.030
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/21-0
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.590
<v thomas broussard>So if I'm not wrong,
last time we did not do any join.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/23-0
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.669
<v thomas broussard>Statements, right?
We have not started yet,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/23-1
00:01:56.669 --> 00:02:00.350
<v thomas broussard>so we are a bit behind in terms of
contents.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/24-0
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.030
<v thomas broussard>Let's me uh.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/25-0
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.670
<v thomas broussard>Check that.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/26-0
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.550
<v thomas broussard>This is right here.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/28-0
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:29.350
<v thomas broussard>So.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/29-0
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.830
<v thomas broussard>OK, so let's just have a look. Bonjour.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/30-0
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.150
<v thomas broussard>Let's just have a look to the to the
overall. Um</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/31-0
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.710
<v thomas broussard>Map I would say of this database.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/32-0
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.150
<v thomas broussard>It looks like this.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/33-0
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.470
<v thomas broussard>If you remember the last thing that we
did.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/35-0
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.425
<v thomas broussard>Last thing that we did was to import the
club data database in my database,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/35-1
00:03:14.425 --> 00:03:21.190
<v thomas broussard>in my private close down database and the
diagram looks like this.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/36-0
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.390
<v thomas broussard>What does that mean? We have 3 tables and.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/37-0
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.350
<v thomas broussard>How many leaks?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/39-0
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.532
<v thomas broussard>We have feelings. What is good,
what is usual I would say is to check</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/39-1
00:03:42.532 --> 00:03:48.529
<v thomas broussard>that we have good things which is in
between facilities and members that that</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/39-2
00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:54.142
<v thomas broussard>it's like normal, it's central.
We have this news connection from member</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/39-3
00:03:54.142 --> 00:03:54.910
<v thomas broussard>to member.</v>

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.910
<v thomas broussard>What does that mean?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/41-0
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.190
<v thomas broussard>We have this real connection.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/42-0
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.430
<v thomas broussard>That's the next members, the members.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/43-0
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:15.630
<v thomas broussard>Do you remember? Do you know what it is?
Why do we have a loop on members?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/44-0
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.190
<v thomas broussard>There's a connection from member to
member.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/47-0
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:34.336
<v thomas broussard>What is good is with that diagram is that
you have only one Click to understand</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/47-1
00:04:34.336 --> 00:04:38.790
<v thomas broussard>what makes the link if you click on the
link.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/48-0
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.795
<v thomas broussard>You will see what connects what data in
connection with what order from the</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/48-1
00:04:45.795 --> 00:04:49.520
<v thomas broussard>remote table.
So here bookings we point the I think</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/48-2
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.672
<v thomas broussard>here points to make my idea of the
members.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/48-3
00:04:52.672 --> 00:04:56.110
<v thomas broussard>So that means that here we have what we
call a.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/49-0
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:08.418
<v thomas broussard>That's with key. We have a foreign key.
We have a foreign key between bookings</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/49-1
00:05:08.418 --> 00:05:13.868
<v thomas broussard>and members,
and here we can see that this name ID has</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/49-2
00:05:13.868 --> 00:05:15.750
<v thomas broussard>a special symbolic.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/50-0
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:23.986
<v thomas broussard>Representation is because this is the the
primary queue of members.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/50-1
00:05:23.986 --> 00:05:32.073
<v thomas broussard>So MMI is the primary queue of members
and it is targeted by authority from</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/50-2
00:05:32.073 --> 00:05:33.030
<v thomas broussard>bookings.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/51-0
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.830
<v thomas broussard>To remember.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/53-0
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.670
<v thomas broussard>OK, so why do we do that? You remember?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/54-0
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:46.150
<v thomas broussard>Why do we do these primary piece for
increase and so on?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/55-0
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:55.630
<v thomas broussard>It will send data, so real use data.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/57-0
00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.823
<v thomas broussard>To connect data, yes.
When you have to retrieve data from to</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/57-1
00:06:03.823 --> 00:06:09.977
<v thomas broussard>make the production to avoid repeating
the booking member names, address,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/57-2
00:06:09.977 --> 00:06:14.051
<v thomas broussard>etcetera.
Every every time when we do a booking,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/57-3
00:06:14.051 --> 00:06:17.710
<v thomas broussard>we just say we have a booking ID number
ID.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/58-0
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.476
<v thomas broussard>And then we point to this number ID
whenever we need to make a reference to</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/58-1
00:06:22.476 --> 00:06:25.620
<v thomas broussard>that number.
And that's the same for the facility.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/58-2
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.367
<v thomas broussard>I don't care of repeating all those
information because I know them already.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/58-3
00:06:30.367 --> 00:06:33.203
<v thomas broussard>So instead of repeating them,
what I will do,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/58-4
00:06:33.203 --> 00:06:34.990
<v thomas broussard>I will create a link between.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/59-0
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:41.473
<v thomas broussard>Bookings and facilities through the
correspondence of facility ID equal</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/59-1
00:06:41.473 --> 00:06:45.951
<v thomas broussard>facility ID.
The question now is what if I want to</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/59-2
00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:46.390
<v thomas broussard>have?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/60-0
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:57.190
<v thomas broussard>A research of a query that will aggregate
several data from different tables.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/61-0
00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:59.430
<v thomas broussard>For me.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/62-0
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.750
<v thomas broussard>Next time the last one,
we'll bring the breakfast for everyone.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/63-0
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.750
<v thomas broussard>At this phone.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/65-0
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.523
<v thomas broussard>OK,
so what I said here is it's easy to get</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/65-1
00:07:16.523 --> 00:07:22.688
<v thomas broussard>all the data from one paper.
Do you remember I've seen that very</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/65-2
00:07:22.688 --> 00:07:27.430
<v thomas broussard>quickly at the end of the last lecture is
select.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/66-0
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:33.494
<v thomas broussard>Start from the table.
Select start from table.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/66-1
00:07:33.494 --> 00:07:38.647
<v thomas broussard>We return everything which we have in the
table.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/66-2
00:07:38.647 --> 00:07:43.590
<v thomas broussard>Select for instance here name and member
cost.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/67-0
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:51.566
<v thomas broussard>From facilities we will get only the name
and the number cost for this table for</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/67-1
00:07:51.566 --> 00:07:57.806
<v thomas broussard>each entry in this table.
So you see you select the column names</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/67-2
00:07:57.806 --> 00:07:59.630
<v thomas broussard>and it will return.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/68-0
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:06.790
<v thomas broussard>In the output the problem now is what if
I want to have the list of bookings plus</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/68-1
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:13.128
<v thomas broussard>not the facility ID because I haven't
already on in each booking I have the</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/68-2
00:08:13.128 --> 00:08:15.630
<v thomas broussard>facility ID which is good but.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/69-0
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.900
<v thomas broussard>As a human,
I don't care about the facilitators.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/69-1
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:23.458
<v thomas broussard>If you see a list of pilots,
you will be a bit trust if I try to dump</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/69-2
00:08:23.458 --> 00:08:25.150
<v thomas broussard>the list of students here.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/70-0
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.110
<v thomas broussard>If I have only the IDs.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/71-0
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:38.470
<v thomas broussard>We have been dry because I don't know who
it was. No response to what I.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/72-0
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.645
<v thomas broussard>So it would be a bit difficult if we work
only with IDs.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/72-1
00:08:43.645 --> 00:08:47.282
<v thomas broussard>Humans need to have the functional data,
the business data.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/72-2
00:08:47.282 --> 00:08:50.070
<v thomas broussard>So that means that here we need to have
that.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/73-0
00:08:51.350 --> 00:09:00.372
<v thomas broussard>Resolution of the link that we have here
in order to in order to have to take</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/73-1
00:09:00.372 --> 00:09:06.270
<v thomas broussard>advantage of the link that we have set up
between.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/74-0
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:14.776
<v thomas broussard>Let's let's maybe let's do a small
introduction about whispering.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/74-1
00:09:14.776 --> 00:09:17.950
<v thomas broussard>Whispering it when you talk. Let's.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/75-0
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:25.997
<v thomas broussard>So that's it. Sure. You see,
you can't even even maybe listen to me</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/75-1
00:09:25.997 --> 00:09:33.858
<v thomas broussard>because it's too low, but that's perfect.
If you want to chat, use whispering.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/75-2
00:09:33.858 --> 00:09:35.350
<v thomas broussard>Thank you guys.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/76-0
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:39.867
<v thomas broussard>OK, so you can check. OK,
I'm not sure whether you want to talk</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/76-1
00:09:39.867 --> 00:09:42.270
<v thomas broussard>about everything extend the database.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/77-0
00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:49.293
<v thomas broussard>You will be concerned at the end because
of course the the results of your exam</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/77-1
00:09:49.293 --> 00:09:53.257
<v thomas broussard>will be a bit down,
maybe low because you will not have</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/77-2
00:09:53.257 --> 00:09:57.433
<v thomas broussard>listen, but except of the receipt,
I will not be troubled.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/77-3
00:09:57.433 --> 00:09:58.990
<v thomas broussard>Just do not bother me.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/79-0
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:03.582
<v thomas broussard>By talking loud. OK,
So what I said is that if we can't,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/79-1
00:10:03.582 --> 00:10:09.413
<v thomas broussard>if we can take advantage of the link that
we have set up between 2 tables,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/79-2
00:10:09.413 --> 00:10:15.710
<v thomas broussard>it means that we can as well resolve data
from one primary table to another one.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/80-0
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.470
<v thomas broussard>One for instance is that if I want to
have the bookings.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/81-0
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:28.585
<v thomas broussard>Not only facility ID but facility name.
I will have to use an operator which is</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/81-1
00:10:28.585 --> 00:10:34.219
<v thomas broussard>called join.
OK so for instance here I could say in my</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/81-2
00:10:34.219 --> 00:10:35.550
<v thomas broussard>query editor.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/82-0
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:43.590
<v thomas broussard>If I have.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/83-0
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.830
<v thomas broussard>The list of Boo if I want the list of
bookings.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/84-0
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.390
<v thomas broussard>This is to limit the the result to 10.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/85-0
00:10:58.910 --> 00:10:59.950
<v thomas broussard>OK, so.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/87-0
00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:05.910
<v thomas broussard>You see it's not so usable the actually
the only functional data are here.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/88-0
00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:11.688
<v thomas broussard>Which is the time,
date and time and then the duration of</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/88-1
00:11:11.688 --> 00:11:15.669
<v thomas broussard>the booking.
Slots is actually the number of time</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/88-2
00:11:15.669 --> 00:11:21.799
<v thomas broussard>slots that you are taking for one booking.
OK, so imagine that we have this.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/88-3
00:11:21.799 --> 00:11:23.550
<v thomas broussard>Now I want to resolve.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/89-0
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:28.470
<v thomas broussard>The facilities using the link that we
have set up.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/91-0
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.550
<v thomas broussard>Between bookings and facility.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/92-0
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:40.030
<v thomas broussard>What's sorry?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/93-0
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:48.220
<v thomas broussard>What's the correspondence?
It's actually facilities ID is</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/93-1
00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:54.350
<v thomas broussard>corresponding corresponding to booking
facility ID. Bonjour.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/94-0
00:11:55.590 --> 00:12:01.717
<v thomas broussard>That makes me having all the data
corresponding to my facility.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/94-1
00:12:01.717 --> 00:12:07.844
<v thomas broussard>I'm resolving everything.
It means that here on the left side I</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/94-2
00:12:07.844 --> 00:12:12.630
<v thomas broussard>have the original query SELECT star from
booking.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/95-0
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:19.247
<v thomas broussard>But after the last column of booking,
I can see new columns here and are</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/95-1
00:12:19.247 --> 00:12:22.150
<v thomas broussard>corresponding to the facilities table.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/96-0
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:34.984
<v thomas broussard>So it's like we have merged 2 tables
merged on what's on what criteria on this</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/96-1
00:12:34.984 --> 00:12:36.150
<v thomas broussard>equality.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/97-0
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:43.583
<v thomas broussard>So what happens behind the scenes when we
do that?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/97-1
00:12:43.583 --> 00:12:50.428
<v thomas broussard>It's taking all the data from the
bookings and every time it finds one data</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/97-2
00:12:50.428 --> 00:12:54.750
<v thomas broussard>in the facilities which matches this
condition.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/98-0
00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:59.790
<v thomas broussard>It happens it at the end of the line for
each line.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/99-0
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:04.603
<v thomas broussard>So it's like a merge,
but it's a horizontal merge.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/99-1
00:13:04.603 --> 00:13:08.190
<v thomas broussard>It's not appending,
it's just appending at the.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/99-2
00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:14.095
<v thomas broussard>For each data that we have for bookings,
we are adding new columns on based on</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/99-3
00:13:14.095 --> 00:13:15.590
<v thomas broussard>that correspondence.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/100-0
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:25.350
<v thomas broussard>OK, mainly here it's a bit long.
We can have only maybe the the time slots.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/101-0
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.510
<v thomas broussard>The time, sorry, the start time.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/102-0
00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:38.470
<v thomas broussard>And the name and maybe the number of
slots.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/103-0
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:50.710
<v thomas broussard>And now we know,
at least for those 10 results, we know.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/105-0
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:58.103
<v thomas broussard>What has been booked for how long and at
what date inside?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/105-1
00:13:58.103 --> 00:14:04.228
<v thomas broussard>Do you understand the concept of join?
It's good that we have spread our data</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/105-2
00:14:04.228 --> 00:14:08.390
<v thomas broussard>over several favors because now we are
raising them.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/106-0
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:14.107
<v thomas broussard>The problem is now to retrieve the word
that I said that we wanted to use,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/106-1
00:14:14.107 --> 00:14:19.936
<v thomas broussard>maybe to present within an application,
maybe to build a prediction that assets,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/106-2
00:14:19.936 --> 00:14:23.390
<v thomas broussard>maybe to do visualizations, etcetera. OK,
good.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/107-0
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.430
<v thomas broussard>So let's go back to the theory.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/111-0
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:49.870
<v thomas broussard>Bonjour.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/112-0
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.350
<v thomas broussard>But.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/113-0
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.950
<v thomas broussard>Yes,
one point that is important to recall.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/114-0
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:14.430
<v thomas broussard>I will base my evaluation on this
exercise.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/115-0
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:25.479
<v thomas broussard>I'm I'm not sure.
I can't remember if I've introduced that</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/115-1
00:15:25.479 --> 00:15:29.837
<v thomas broussard>website to you. OK, I have. I did that.
Bonjour.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/115-2
00:15:29.837 --> 00:15:32.950
<v thomas broussard>So you can check this and train as.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/116-0
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.070
<v thomas broussard>Much as possible.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/117-0
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:51.910
<v thomas broussard>Because the exam will be based on this
kind of of exercise.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/118-0
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:54.790
<v thomas broussard>OK guys.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/119-0
00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:00.310
<v thomas broussard>Uh.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/120-0
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:06.496
<v thomas broussard>OK,
so if I summarize what we have done here,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/120-1
00:16:06.496 --> 00:16:12.264
<v thomas broussard>it's not so interesting.
I think what could be interesting more</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/120-2
00:16:12.264 --> 00:16:16.950
<v thomas broussard>likely is to to the reverse.
Here we are selecting.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/121-0
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:18.910
<v thomas broussard>The bookings.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/124-0
00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:41.504
<v thomas broussard>What does it do here?
It's it select all the bookings where the</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/124-1
00:16:41.504 --> 00:16:45.578
<v thomas broussard>facilities have a monthly maintenance
below 15.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/124-2
00:16:45.578 --> 00:16:52.030
<v thomas broussard>What's the interest is maybe to have the
cheapest bookings to to record to.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/125-0
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:59.000
<v thomas broussard>To to manage, I would say here.
So maybe if I want to do a a a</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/125-1
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.324
<v thomas broussard>profitability calculus,
maybe that could be interesting to start</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/125-2
00:17:05.324 --> 00:17:07.950
<v thomas broussard>with that list of bookings.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/126-0
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.390
<v thomas broussard>Let's see.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/127-0
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:16.822
<v thomas broussard>Now you see that here I'm using a join.
Actually join like this can be replaced</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/127-1
00:17:16.822 --> 00:17:20.100
<v thomas broussard>by inner join.
There are different types of join</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/127-2
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:24.046
<v thomas broussard>depending on of what you want to isolate
in terms of data.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/127-3
00:17:24.046 --> 00:17:27.190
<v thomas broussard>Here we are not asking ourselves,
we just say.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/128-0
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:32.521
<v thomas broussard>Inner join means that you will get all
the connected data,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/128-1
00:17:32.521 --> 00:17:39.654
<v thomas broussard>but sometimes you may have some isolated
data, like data connected to anything. OK,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/128-2
00:17:39.654 --> 00:17:44.070
<v thomas broussard>let me find the illustration because I
can see the.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/129-0
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:48.670
<v thomas broussard>The website I was referring to is dead,
apparently.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/134-0
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:19.230
<v thomas broussard>Well, I can't find exactly what I want,
but this one I think will do.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/135-0
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.990
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/136-0
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:36.510
<v thomas broussard>What we will do?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/137-0
00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:45.710
<v thomas broussard>We do this, this, this, this and that.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/138-0
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:52.796
<v thomas broussard>Because the those ones are not supported
in my secret. Very simple,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/138-1
00:18:52.796 --> 00:18:54.110
<v thomas broussard>as simple as that.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/139-0
00:18:56.070 --> 00:19:01.395
<v thomas broussard>But let me take some examples and while
we have Venn diagrams,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/139-1
00:19:01.395 --> 00:19:08.241
<v thomas broussard>maybe it will remind you of the of the
algebra lectures when you have ensembles,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/139-2
00:19:08.241 --> 00:19:11.030
<v thomas broussard>etcetera. That's exactly it here.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/140-0
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:16.432
<v thomas broussard>We have A&amp;
B which are actually two entities and the</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/140-1
00:19:16.432 --> 00:19:22.499
<v thomas broussard>space inside represent data.
So what we have here in the circle is</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/140-2
00:19:22.499 --> 00:19:26.030
<v thomas broussard>data. We have data from A, data from B.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/141-0
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:32.998
<v thomas broussard>Hence the red parts of the diagram is
actually the selected data,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/141-1
00:19:32.998 --> 00:19:35.270
<v thomas broussard>the data we enrich with.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/142-0
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:41.730
<v thomas broussard>Let's take some example because A&amp;
B is a I'll be the abstracts.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/142-1
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:43.910
<v thomas broussard>Let's take attendance and students.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/143-0
00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:44.990
<v thomas broussard>It.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/144-0
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:51.995
<v thomas broussard>All grades and students,
because I know that you like grades.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/144-1
00:19:51.995 --> 00:19:53.870
<v thomas broussard>You like grades a lot.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/145-0
00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:58.968
<v thomas broussard>And that's why we are talking about
grades.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/145-1
00:19:58.968 --> 00:20:03.938
<v thomas broussard>So we have grades and we have students
here. What are we doing?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/145-2
00:20:03.938 --> 00:20:06.190
<v thomas broussard>We are taking all the grades.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/146-0
00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:11.186
<v thomas broussard>And you see that there's an intersection
between grades and students.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/146-1
00:20:11.186 --> 00:20:12.190
<v thomas broussard>What does that mean?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/147-0
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:19.699
<v thomas broussard>We have grades and the students connected
to the grades and then we have empty</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/147-1
00:20:19.699 --> 00:20:24.093
<v thomas broussard>things here,
which means that we may have some grades</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/147-2
00:20:24.093 --> 00:20:27.510
<v thomas broussard>not connected to anything in the students.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/148-0
00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:34.630
<v thomas broussard>Is that is that possible to have grades?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/150-0
00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:43.950
<v thomas broussard>No, no. In reality it's not possible.
We should have only.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/152-0
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:48.880
<v thomas broussard>Connected data.
So normally when we want to retrieve data,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/152-1
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:54.764
<v thomas broussard>there should be no A which is not
connected to B as in this diagram in</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/152-2
00:20:54.764 --> 00:20:58.576
<v thomas broussard>reality,
but in real life it can happen maybe</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/152-3
00:20:58.576 --> 00:21:01.310
<v thomas broussard>because you have denties as well.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/153-0
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:07.868
<v thomas broussard>But not deleted this grade and so that
means that here we have some grades</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/153-1
00:21:07.868 --> 00:21:14.819
<v thomas broussard>without any connected student can happen
maybe due to a bug or due to a a missing</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/153-2
00:21:14.819 --> 00:21:17.870
<v thomas broussard>step in the in the delete procedure.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/154-0
00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:22.463
<v thomas broussard>OK, so do you understand?
Here we select all the grades,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/154-1
00:21:22.463 --> 00:21:28.289
<v thomas broussard>all the grades connected with students
and here we may have some unconnected</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/154-2
00:21:28.289 --> 00:21:31.996
<v thomas broussard>students.
In that case means that we have grades</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/154-3
00:21:31.996 --> 00:21:34.190
<v thomas broussard>with no student attached, OK.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/155-0
00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:35.990
<v thomas broussard>What is that?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/156-0
00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:39.110
<v thomas broussard>If we follow the same example.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/157-0
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:45.870
<v thomas broussard>What's the use for that? For example,
there is no, as you said,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/157-1
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:52.760
<v thomas broussard>no waste connected to no student.
I agree that normally there should be in</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/157-2
00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.230
<v thomas broussard>the ideal world.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/158-0
00:21:55.190 --> 00:22:01.156
<v thomas broussard>There should be no difference between
left joint and inner joint. If you miss,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/158-1
00:22:01.156 --> 00:22:06.820
<v thomas broussard>you have full walking, free walking,
rational database because the goal of</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/158-2
00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:12.030
<v thomas broussard>rational database is greatly and if you
have deadly then means that.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/159-0
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:13.510
<v thomas broussard>You have an issue.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/160-0
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:18.675
<v thomas broussard>So in reality,
you always have to follow one table</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/160-1
00:22:18.675 --> 00:22:20.230
<v thomas broussard>compared to another.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/161-0
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:25.670
<v thomas broussard>Then ask yourself what's what's important
to have the grace.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/162-0
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:31.150
<v thomas broussard>All to have only the greatest that are
connected to things.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/163-0
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:33.350
<v thomas broussard>This is the first question.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/164-0
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:40.833
<v thomas broussard>You want all the data from table or all
the connected data compared to another</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/164-1
00:22:40.833 --> 00:22:41.270
<v thomas broussard>table.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/165-0
00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:47.933
<v thomas broussard>See because this and that can be a price
and this is why the left joint ensure</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/165-1
00:22:47.933 --> 00:22:50.510
<v thomas broussard>that you will have all the data from.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/166-0
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:58.070
<v thomas broussard>The left join exclusive which is just
below here is all the data from A which</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/166-1
00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:02.520
<v thomas broussard>are not connected to B.
So here mainly this is a level query.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/166-2
00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:07.833
<v thomas broussard>You want to have all the data which
should be connected but which are not</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/166-3
00:23:07.833 --> 00:23:08.550
<v thomas broussard>connected.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/167-0
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:12.251
<v thomas broussard>Here the inner join only the connected
data,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/167-1
00:23:12.251 --> 00:23:17.620
<v thomas broussard>but be careful because if you do inner
join you will miss potentially some</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/167-2
00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:22.129
<v thomas broussard>unconnected data. OK,
so it depends what you want to do if you</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/167-3
00:23:22.129 --> 00:23:26.710
<v thomas broussard>want to have for instance all the the
counts of all the grades.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/168-0
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:31.959
<v thomas broussard>True,
it's weird to have great which are not</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/168-1
00:23:31.959 --> 00:23:35.844
<v thomas broussard>connected to students,
so maybe we should ask ourselves why they</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/168-2
00:23:35.844 --> 00:23:40.505
<v thomas broussard>are here and should we count steps.
But if they are here and you are asked to</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/168-3
00:23:40.505 --> 00:23:43.612
<v thomas broussard>do statistics,
then maybe you should dump your full</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/168-4
00:23:43.612 --> 00:23:44.030
<v thomas broussard>counts.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/169-0
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:49.590
<v thomas broussard>Of the the grades that you have.
So amazing more this one. OK hence.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/170-0
00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:55.830
<v thomas broussard>It should not be different from this one,
but it could be.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/171-0
00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:56.990
<v thomas broussard>You see?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/172-0
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:03.548
<v thomas broussard>So if you have a difference in counts in
terms of count between this and that,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/172-1
00:24:03.548 --> 00:24:07.230
<v thomas broussard>it means that you have somewhere some
data which are not connected.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/173-0
00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:09.190
<v thomas broussard>It.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/174-0
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:16.466
<v thomas broussard>Here what it does in in addition to the
original select star from A,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/174-1
00:24:16.466 --> 00:24:23.639
<v thomas broussard>it does select star from A plus all the
dates are connected to A from and you see</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/174-2
00:24:23.639 --> 00:24:26.350
<v thomas broussard>that we have a long space here.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/175-0
00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:30.544
<v thomas broussard>Actually,
it will appear as new values in our</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/175-1
00:24:30.544 --> 00:24:34.573
<v thomas broussard>results. We'll see.
We'll practice that very soon.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/175-2
00:24:34.573 --> 00:24:40.656
<v thomas broussard>Let's keep in mind simple example,
A equal attendance, B equal students. OK,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/175-3
00:24:40.656 --> 00:24:42.630
<v thomas broussard>and here what we do here.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/176-0
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:49.954
<v thomas broussard>If we go on the reverse,
so here we select all the students and</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/176-1
00:24:49.954 --> 00:24:57.990
<v thomas broussard>potentially the attached grades and here
we select all the students with no grades.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/177-0
00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:04.524
<v thomas broussard>Which is weird as well.
Maybe it's a student who has declared</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/177-1
00:25:04.524 --> 00:25:08.981
<v thomas broussard>himself as a student but never came to
the new lecture,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/177-2
00:25:08.981 --> 00:25:14.710
<v thomas broussard>never came to a new exam and so he has no
grades. Or maybe he was sick.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/178-0
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:19.126
<v thomas broussard>I don't know,
but this is a way to isolate those</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/178-1
00:25:19.126 --> 00:25:23.430
<v thomas broussard>specific data.
So your added value as an engineer.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/179-0
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:27.990
<v thomas broussard>Is not to know how to write this,
but to identify the case.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/180-0
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:34.451
<v thomas broussard>You see,
to play on I I need to have all the data</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/180-1
00:25:34.451 --> 00:25:39.810
<v thomas broussard>from A by default,
so it means that I will have to use a</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/180-2
00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:40.750
<v thomas broussard>left join.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/181-0
00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:46.306
<v thomas broussard>And after that, how to write a left join,
it's a detail.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/181-1
00:25:46.306 --> 00:25:50.239
<v thomas broussard>So it's the conversion between the
business input.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/181-2
00:25:50.239 --> 00:25:55.791
<v thomas broussard>I want this from the business,
so I want all the students which have no</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/181-3
00:25:55.791 --> 00:25:57.950
<v thomas broussard>grade and you have to think.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/182-0
00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:01.816
<v thomas broussard>And in your mind you should have this
diagram,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/182-1
00:26:01.816 --> 00:26:07.510
<v thomas broussard>small diagram that says student with no
grade could be right join excluding OK.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/183-0
00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:13.590
<v thomas broussard>So how do we write this?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/184-0
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:16.910
<v thomas broussard>Let's do an exercise.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/185-0
00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:23.710
<v thomas broussard>I have um.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/186-0
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.950
<v thomas broussard>A script.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/187-0
00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.310
<v thomas broussard>Let me share it with you.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/190-0
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:52.964
<v thomas broussard>OK, so the first exercise,
the first small exercise is to create a</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/190-1
00:26:52.964 --> 00:26:54.030
<v thomas broussard>new database.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/191-0
00:26:55.550 --> 00:27:02.190
<v thomas broussard>On your system and this database has to
be called SQL join exercise.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/192-0
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:06.750
<v thomas broussard>Let's create a new database join.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/194-0
00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:09.150
<v thomas broussard>Exercises.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/195-0
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:17.193
<v thomas broussard>You see that as soon as I create
something here,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/195-1
00:27:17.193 --> 00:27:20.910
<v thomas broussard>I will create a new folder join exercise.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/196-0
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:31.110
<v thomas broussard>And then once you have this,
the idea is to take.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/197-0
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:33.910
<v thomas broussard>Peace.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/198-0
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:37.550
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/199-0
00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:44.470
<v thomas broussard>Create new file.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/200-0
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:51.470
<v thomas broussard>That's it. OK, first load the data.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/201-0
00:27:55.710 --> 00:28:00.070
<v thomas broussard>And you see that here it's said known,
so that means not connected to anything.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/202-0
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:04.830
<v thomas broussard>Not grab data join exercise.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/203-0
00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:08.110
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/204-0
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:15.667
<v thomas broussard>And then if you remember that if you want
to execute as a script,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/204-1
00:28:15.667 --> 00:28:21.524
<v thomas broussard>just use the third execution button.
Normally you should have two tables plus</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/204-2
00:28:21.524 --> 00:28:26.781
<v thomas broussard>16 rows, so that means 18 queries.
If you have a look now to the join</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/204-3
00:28:26.781 --> 00:28:30.310
<v thomas broussard>exercise,
you should have table A and table B.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/205-0
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:34.802
<v thomas broussard>B.
You recognize that what I want is to have</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/205-1
00:28:34.802 --> 00:28:39.550
<v thomas broussard>table A and table B here,
so let's just select.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/206-0
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:46.150
<v thomas broussard>Anything.
Let's rename this to dump dot SQL.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/207-0
00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:51.070
<v thomas broussard>Let's create a new file.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/208-0
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:56.990
<v thomas broussard>That I could join practice.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/209-0
00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:05.470
<v thomas broussard>And then I do select star from A.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/210-0
00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.870
<v thomas broussard>It's not a, actually it's table A.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/211-0
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:18.790
<v thomas broussard>OK, this is what I have in a.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/212-0
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:24.670
<v thomas broussard>Now let's see what what happens when we
have a left join.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/213-0
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:27.590
<v thomas broussard>Table B.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/214-0
00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:31.750
<v thomas broussard>On.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/217-0
00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:46.830
<v thomas broussard>Yeah.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/218-0
00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:49.670
<v thomas broussard>What happens here?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/219-0
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:54.990
<v thomas broussard>We are doing a join.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/220-0
00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:02.224
<v thomas broussard>And to to make sure the join does not
create rows that could match several</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/220-1
00:30:02.224 --> 00:30:06.683
<v thomas broussard>times, we use the PK.
Usually we use the primary key in order</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/220-2
00:30:06.683 --> 00:30:10.350
<v thomas broussard>to set up the match condition between 2
rows, yes.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/222-0
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:22.110
<v thomas broussard>Come again, please.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/223-0
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:24.110
<v thomas broussard>Yeah.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/224-0
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:34.378
<v thomas broussard>Yes, you you could on general on NSSQL,
but here it's not possible. Yeah,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/224-1
00:30:34.378 --> 00:30:38.590
<v thomas broussard>because actually there's no name for the
primary key in MySQL.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/225-0
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:44.030
<v thomas broussard>You see, it's this one is optional.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/226-0
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:46.590
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/228-0
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:55.013
<v thomas broussard>It will take by default the primary key,
but here we have no primary key,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/228-1
00:30:55.013 --> 00:31:02.085
<v thomas broussard>so I feel it's a bit tricky to rely on
this on this default behavior because it</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/228-2
00:31:02.085 --> 00:31:04.030
<v thomas broussard>does not force you to.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/229-0
00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:07.665
<v thomas broussard>To think about what should match,
but usually yes,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/229-1
00:31:07.665 --> 00:31:13.110
<v thomas broussard>we we match on primary key and but it's
not mandatory, you can have more than.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/230-0
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:17.870
<v thomas broussard>One condition here can have hands.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/231-0
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:24.683
<v thomas broussard>And do your list of conditions.
So if you have a very specific join which</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/231-1
00:31:24.683 --> 00:31:28.618
<v thomas broussard>is not only relying on the presence of
primary keys,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/231-2
00:31:28.618 --> 00:31:32.032
<v thomas broussard>but you want to filter as well some
elements,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/231-3
00:31:32.032 --> 00:31:34.630
<v thomas broussard>you can have another kind of match.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/232-0
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:35.590
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/233-0
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:44.671
<v thomas broussard>Let's stay on the simple aspect for now
and let's see what happens if we do that.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/233-1
00:31:44.671 --> 00:31:48.696
<v thomas broussard>If you notice here,
we have all the rules from A.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/233-2
00:31:48.696 --> 00:31:50.950
<v thomas broussard>We have all the data from A.</v>

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:56.070
<v thomas broussard>We have some data from me.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/235-0
00:31:57.030 --> 00:32:04.853
<v thomas broussard>Here at line 123 and line 67.
OK and we have some null values here.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/235-1
00:32:04.853 --> 00:32:11.870
<v thomas broussard>If we think it's actually here,
we have all the data from A.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/236-0
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:19.518
<v thomas broussard>We will have some data from A that
corresponds to B and we have assigned to</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/236-1
00:32:19.518 --> 00:32:26.497
<v thomas broussard>an A value some values in B which are
empty and that means that we have null</v>

00:32:26.497 --> 00:32:26.950
<v thomas broussard>here.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/237-0
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:31.550
<v thomas broussard>How to select only?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/238-0
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:35.670

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:50.590
<v thomas broussard>I mean just looking at this query.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/241-0
00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:58.559
<v thomas broussard>And the result, the table.
What's the condition that I should add to</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/241-1
00:32:58.559 --> 00:33:03.910
<v thomas broussard>this result in order to have only the
data which are only in A?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/242-0
00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:09.430
<v thomas broussard>If.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/243-0
00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:12.670
<v thomas broussard>No idea.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/244-0
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:16.990
<v thomas broussard>Tell me what rules are only in a.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/245-0
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:25.270
<v thomas broussard>What are the rules which are only in A?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/246-0
00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:27.910
<v thomas broussard>This one.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/247-0
00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:33.968
<v thomas broussard>No, no,
because here we have some data which are</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/247-1
00:33:33.968 --> 00:33:34.910
<v thomas broussard>OK, it should.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/248-0
00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:42.367
<v thomas broussard>Let me reformulate the question.
What are the data which are which are</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/248-1
00:33:42.367 --> 00:33:45.150
<v thomas broussard>only a PK value which is only a?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/249-0
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:56.884
<v thomas broussard>The least like like John and then there
will be exactly where PK is or PK is not.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/249-1
00:33:56.884 --> 00:34:03.510
<v thomas broussard>If you look at the condition,
the data which are only a.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/250-0
00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:09.312
<v thomas broussard>It's line 4, line 5 and line 8. Yep,
because how do we know that?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/250-1
00:34:09.312 --> 00:34:14.756
<v thomas broussard>Because it has null on the B side.
So that means it's not connected to B</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/250-2
00:34:14.756 --> 00:34:19.230
<v thomas broussard>point and that means what?
That means that we have as well.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/251-0
00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:29.390
<v thomas broussard>A very easy way to isolate them is to do
where?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/252-0
00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:33.630
<v thomas broussard>Where?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/253-0
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:41.110
<v thomas broussard>V dot PK is new.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/254-0
00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:52.830
<v thomas broussard>And here we have the table A data which
are only in A and not found in B.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/255-0
00:34:54.390 --> 00:34:55.670
<v thomas broussard>Understood.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/256-0
00:34:56.750 --> 00:35:06.310
<v thomas broussard>Good. So if you have understood,
then let's do all the rest of the joins.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/258-0
00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:15.390
<v thomas broussard>Um.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/259-0
00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:23.510
<v thomas broussard>So this is.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/260-0
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:25.030
<v thomas broussard>It.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/261-0
00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:29.590
<v thomas broussard>Left join exclusive.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/262-0
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:38.390
<v thomas broussard>Left join is this.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/263-0
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.470
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/264-0
00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:51.787
<v thomas broussard>And now I would like you to find to
practice inner join. It's pretty easy.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/264-1
00:35:51.787 --> 00:35:58.061
<v thomas broussard>Inner join is instead of left you do
inner and right join you do right instead</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/264-2
00:35:58.061 --> 00:36:02.190
<v thomas broussard>of left.
So but just to have a look to the results.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/265-0
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:03.670
<v thomas broussard>It provides.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/266-0
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:10.990
<v thomas broussard>Please do me the three remaining jobs,
inner join, right join, right join.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/273-0
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:53.310
<v thomas broussard>Yes.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/283-0
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.110
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/284-0
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:58.070
<v thomas broussard>Yeah.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/288-0
00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:17.870
<v thomas broussard>So, so again.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/289-0
00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:31.793
<v thomas broussard>So it means that some of the ancestry are
not here. I would send you the link,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/289-1
00:38:31.793 --> 00:38:38.295
<v thomas broussard>the redistributable,
which I'm not here anymore.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/289-2
00:38:38.295 --> 00:38:40.550
<v thomas broussard>I don't know why.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/290-0
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:44.510
<v thomas broussard>Maybe you haven't installed something? No.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/291-0
00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:49.320
<v thomas broussard>Yeah,
but have you uninstalled something which</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/291-1
00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:53.398
<v thomas broussard>is not MySQL but you have still
uninstalled something? No,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/291-2
00:38:53.398 --> 00:38:58.030
<v thomas broussard>you have made no change on the on the
data, on the on your system.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/297-0
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:32.190
<v thomas broussard>So.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/298-0
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:39.630
<v thomas broussard>What's your name?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/299-0
00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:43.870
<v thomas broussard>Yes.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/301-0
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.950
<v thomas broussard>This one.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/306-0
00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:19.710
<v thomas broussard>Mhm.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/311-0
00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:58.030
<v thomas broussard>All right.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/312-0
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:02.510
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/314-0
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:13.230
<v thomas broussard>Mhm.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/316-0
00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:25.310
<v thomas broussard>Mhm.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/324-0
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:16.030
<v thomas broussard>Let's see.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/328-0
00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:33.710
<v thomas broussard>OK, so.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/330-0
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:42.270
<v thomas broussard>Normally 3 queries should be very easy to
and quick to write.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/331-0
00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:44.710
<v thomas broussard>So I.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/332-0
00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:51.070
<v thomas broussard>Go again. This is the left join exclusive.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/333-0
00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:56.956
<v thomas broussard>Have a look here. It's two comments,
some lines.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/333-1
00:42:56.956 --> 00:43:00.430
<v thomas broussard>It's dash O we can have the right join.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/334-0
00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:09.824
<v thomas broussard>You see,
it's a bit weird because we select from</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/334-1
00:43:09.824 --> 00:43:14.230
<v thomas broussard>the table,
but here what do we expect to have?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/335-0
00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:18.070
<v thomas broussard>All the data from.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/336-0
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:24.525
<v thomas broussard>B. So we select table A,
but we expect to have all the values from</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/336-1
00:43:24.525 --> 00:43:30.895
<v thomas broussard>B. For me it's a bit counterintuitive.
This is why I'm not using the right join</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/336-2
00:43:30.895 --> 00:43:34.717
<v thomas broussard>so fun,
but this is in the result what we have.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/336-3
00:43:34.717 --> 00:43:36.230
<v thomas broussard>So we have all the.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/337-0
00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:38.230
<v thomas broussard>Data from here as expected.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/338-0
00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:45.317
<v thomas broussard>Data from B,
some data connected from A connected to B.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/338-1
00:43:45.317 --> 00:43:50.185
<v thomas broussard>OK,
so based on the equivalence of the PK and</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/338-2
00:43:50.185 --> 00:43:54.630
<v thomas broussard>some non matching data from A from B in A.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/340-0
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:58.350
<v thomas broussard>OK, so if I want to isolate only the.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/341-0
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:02.510
<v thomas broussard>Not connected data, the unconnected data.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/342-0
00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:06.510
<v thomas broussard>I can do my right join exclusive.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/346-0
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:25.674
<v thomas broussard>Pay attention, it's not equal null,
it's is null, or is not null. So this is,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/346-1
00:44:25.674 --> 00:44:32.470
<v thomas broussard>these are the data from B,
which are not connected to anything in A.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/347-0
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:36.030
<v thomas broussard>Now let's do the inner join.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/354-0
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:15.150
<v thomas broussard>Self join. What do you mean by self join?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/356-0
00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:28.990
<v thomas broussard>Yeah.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/357-0
00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:42.968
<v thomas broussard>Self join. OK, yeah, actually self join.
I think it's not something which is in</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/357-1
00:45:42.968 --> 00:45:48.868
<v thomas broussard>the common SQL. Well,
so it's maybe a shortcut to join on</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/357-2
00:45:48.868 --> 00:45:50.190
<v thomas broussard>yourself and.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/358-0
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:56.221
<v thomas broussard>Honestly, I never used it, so I can tell.
But if we go back to the previews</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/358-1
00:45:56.221 --> 00:46:00.156
<v thomas broussard>database,
you remember that we have something which</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/358-2
00:46:00.156 --> 00:46:05.830
<v thomas broussard>points to itself, which is the members,
and here it's interesting because.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/359-0
00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:11.030
<v thomas broussard>Thanks to this, for instance,
if we do a join on the same table.</v>

00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:16.590
<v thomas broussard>Like this select star from members.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/361-0
00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:24.347
<v thomas broussard>Join so we can do inner join.
We expect all the data to be connected.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/361-1
00:46:24.347 --> 00:46:29.344
<v thomas broussard>Maybe that could be interesting to have
as well the unconnected data.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/361-2
00:46:29.344 --> 00:46:34.555
<v thomas broussard>So we take all the members list,
we keep it full and then we will try to</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/361-3
00:46:34.555 --> 00:46:36.910
<v thomas broussard>append the corresponding members.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/362-0
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:41.550
<v thomas broussard>On the right side, so left join.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/363-0
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.950
<v thomas broussard>Members.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/364-0
00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:57.987
<v thomas broussard>On M dot memid equal M2 dot recommended
by because we have seen it was the the</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/364-1
00:46:57.987 --> 00:47:00.670
<v thomas broussard>foreign key to itself.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/365-0
00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:08.468
<v thomas broussard>And here, what do we see?
We see all the information from A,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/365-1
00:47:08.468 --> 00:47:13.585
<v thomas broussard>which is the member,
and some corresponding values here. OK,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/365-2
00:47:13.585 --> 00:47:18.870
<v thomas broussard>these on the right side are actually the
percent that we have.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/366-0
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:21.150
<v thomas broussard>That have recommended.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/367-0
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:26.430
<v thomas broussard>The the first part of the members,
so we can say maybe.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/368-0
00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:30.830
<v thomas broussard>Instead of star.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/369-0
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:33.710
<v thomas broussard>First name.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/370-0
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.950
<v thomas broussard>Surname.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/371-0
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:40.990
<v thomas broussard>And here we can say.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/372-0
00:47:43.830 --> 00:47:54.310
<v thomas broussard>M2 dot first name M2 dot last name.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/373-0
00:47:57.310 --> 00:47:58.910
<v thomas broussard>It's surname, sorry.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/377-0
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:23.310
<v thomas broussard>OK, so I've run here.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/378-0
00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:31.720
<v thomas broussard>We can see the links of persons who have
been recommended by someone else.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/378-1
00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:37.523
<v thomas broussard>So apparently guest has been recommended
by no one. That seems normal.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/378-2
00:48:37.523 --> 00:48:40.710
<v thomas broussard>But this person has been recommended by</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/379-0
00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:42.190
<v thomas broussard>This.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/380-0
00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:47.883
<v thomas broussard>Janice droplets,
but as well these gerald butters,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/380-1
00:48:47.883 --> 00:48:51.670
<v thomas broussard>that's a bit weird to have this in that
way.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/381-0
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:58.910
<v thomas broussard>You commented by yes.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/382-0
00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:02.350
<v thomas broussard>I maybe.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/383-0
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:11.487
<v thomas broussard>Sorry,
I would have expected to find only one</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/383-1
00:49:11.487 --> 00:49:12.670
<v thomas broussard>person here.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/384-0
00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:18.350
<v thomas broussard>Maximum on this side,
but apparently we have more than one.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/386-0
00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:26.804
<v thomas broussard>So what does that mean when we have
person who are not connected to anything?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/386-1
00:49:26.804 --> 00:49:32.118
<v thomas broussard>They have not been recommended by anyone.
They just came to the club like this. OK,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/386-2
00:49:32.118 --> 00:49:36.293
<v thomas broussard>so maybe self join was to do something
like this. I I don't know.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/386-3
00:49:36.293 --> 00:49:38.190
<v thomas broussard>Maybe I should document a bit.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/387-0
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:43.417
<v thomas broussard>But you see there are plenty of
variations in SQL that we that we don't</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/387-1
00:49:43.417 --> 00:49:47.672
<v thomas broussard>know. It depends on the vendors,
depends on the usages as well.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/387-2
00:49:47.672 --> 00:49:53.190
<v thomas broussard>So sometimes you just work with a company
and you only what the company gives you.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/388-0
00:49:55.390 --> 00:50:02.857
<v thomas broussard>But normally with right, left, inner,
you should cover whatever is needed. OK,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/388-1
00:50:02.857 --> 00:50:06.070
<v thomas broussard>so let's go back to the club data.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/389-0
00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:13.630
<v thomas broussard>And I would like you to practice a bit to
find 2-3,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/389-1
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:23.350
<v thomas broussard>maybe maximum 5 queries that are using
joint. OK, no more point to connect data.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/390-0
00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:26.110
<v thomas broussard>The.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/391-0
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:30.350
<v thomas broussard>Mhm.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/395-0
00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:45.110
<v thomas broussard>Small.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/396-0
00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:48.310
<v thomas broussard>So.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/397-0
00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:50.750
<v thomas broussard>It.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/398-0
00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:56.750
<v thomas broussard>We.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/400-0
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:09.670
<v thomas broussard>It.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/402-0
00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:17.144
<v thomas broussard>Maybe it's because you have not imported
the the club data, the club data.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/402-1
00:51:17.144 --> 00:51:22.794
<v thomas broussard>It's in the I provided it last time.
So in teams you should have done the SQL</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/402-2
00:51:22.794 --> 00:51:24.750
<v thomas broussard>file. Have a look at teams.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/403-0
00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:31.230
<v thomas broussard>What?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/404-0
00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:41.014
<v thomas broussard>This one you should create a new database.
How to create a new database?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/404-1
00:51:41.014 --> 00:51:43.670
<v thomas broussard>It's right click on databases.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/405-0
00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:53.665
<v thomas broussard>Create new database and then once you
have this you will open a new SQL scripts,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/405-1
00:51:53.665 --> 00:51:58.550
<v thomas broussard>copy paste the dum dot SQL,
run the dum dot SQL.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/406-0
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:08.190
<v thomas broussard>Yes, but this is.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/407-0
00:52:09.350 --> 00:52:11.590
<v thomas broussard>I will look to what is inside.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/408-0
00:52:12.990 --> 00:52:13.710
<v thomas broussard>Language.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/409-0
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:20.709
<v thomas broussard>So you have nothing my recommend.
I recommend that you you name the</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/409-1
00:52:20.709 --> 00:52:25.218
<v thomas broussard>databases accordingly to what we what
they are doing.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/409-2
00:52:25.218 --> 00:52:31.230
<v thomas broussard>So if you practice what it's not so
useful to understand what it means.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/409-3
00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:33.150
<v thomas broussard>So I will create maybe.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/410-0
00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:38.510
<v thomas broussard>But to clear then create new database
data.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/411-0
00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:42.670
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/412-0
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:59.870
<v thomas broussard>That's it now. Let's credit the talk.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/413-0
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:09.423
<v thomas broussard>And then we copy paste like that's here.
But don't that you have just what you</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/413-1
00:53:09.423 --> 00:53:11.750
<v thomas broussard>have that I don't know.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/414-0
00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:21.070
<v thomas broussard>Sure. Yeah.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/415-0
00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:25.390
<v thomas broussard>General.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/416-0
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.750
<v thomas broussard>I took you.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/417-0
00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:34.390
<v thomas broussard>Oh.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/418-0
00:53:36.070 --> 00:53:36.270
<v thomas broussard>S.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/419-0
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:46.590
<v thomas broussard>And now you execute everything.
It's the self.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/420-0
00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:54.310
<v thomas broussard>So now you should refresh this one,
wipe it.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/421-0
00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:55.950
<v thomas broussard>Refresh.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/422-0
00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:03.590
<v thomas broussard>What's going through them?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/423-0
00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:08.110
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/424-0
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:14.990
<v thomas broussard>Uh, so this one is a new data,
the other one. So now it will be quick.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/425-0
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:19.790
<v thomas broussard>So I click on that. It's great, yeah.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/426-0
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:23.150
<v thomas broussard>Join the service.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/427-0
00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:35.656
<v thomas broussard>OK. And then yes,
create a new file actually you'll have it.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/427-1
00:54:35.656 --> 00:54:42.830
<v thomas broussard>So you can here join practice other joins
practices just.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/428-0
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:55.950
<v thomas broussard>Yeah, but we will reorganize later.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/429-0

<v thomas broussard>Refresher, you will see.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/433-0
00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:36.094
<v thomas broussard>After you get into it,

00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:56.310
<v thomas broussard>You have to remember that practice 31 is
actually the joint.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/438-0
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.590
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/439-0

00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:18.807
<v thomas broussard>Yeah, of course. Of course you can do the.
If you notice the right join is nothing</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/441-1
00:56:18.807 --> 00:56:22.230
<v thomas broussard>more than the left join,
but starting from B.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/442-0
00:56:23.790 --> 00:56:31.707
<v thomas broussard>Do select from a left right join B.
It's the same as select B left join A.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/442-1
00:56:31.707 --> 00:56:38.779
<v thomas broussard>It's exactly exactly the same.
It's a matter of the point of view.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/442-2
00:56:38.779 --> 00:56:42.790
<v thomas broussard>Sometimes you're forced to query from.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/443-0
00:56:42.830 --> 00:56:43.070
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/444-0
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:48.608
<v thomas broussard>Because B is not the only table you want
to join. You have,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/444-1
00:56:48.608 --> 00:56:52.570
<v thomas broussard>you can join several times.
It will be the case in bookings.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/444-2
00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:57.962
<v thomas broussard>If we need to have both the members and
facilities details, we need to join twice.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/444-3
00:56:57.962 --> 00:56:59.910

00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:07.950
<v thomas broussard>Let's do 5 minute break.</v>

00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:15.790
<v thomas broussard>And after that I show 5 queries on the
club data.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/448-0
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:29.750

<v thomas broussard>That's what I'm trying to do now.
It's like I'm.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/459-0
00:58:54.550 --> 00:59:03.110
<v thomas broussard>Like this?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/460-0
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:20.350

00:59:59.910 --> 01:00:12.631
<v thomas broussard>OK, yes, this is what we used to do today.
Yes, that's what I'm about to do.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/463-1
01:00:12.631 --> 01:00:16.430
<v thomas broussard>I think it's something.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/464-0
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:29.990

01:00:39.808 --> 01:00:47.091
<v thomas broussard>We we said, but what's up?
And that's when you're still dependent.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/466-2
01:00:47.091 --> 01:00:49.590
<v thomas broussard>That's it. That's fine.</v>

01:00:58.937 --> 01:01:05.464
<v thomas broussard>but basically it's the right. Yeah,

01:01:17.416 --> 01:01:21.630
<v thomas broussard>the script you need to direct it to...</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/471-0
01:01:23.110 --> 01:01:31.770
<v thomas broussard>No, no beta exist, but suggested. Yeah,

01:01:31.770 --> 01:01:40.430
<v thomas broussard>you just look for this, right?
You click on it and you select your.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/472-0
01:01:41.110 --> 01:01:52.343
<v thomas broussard>And it flips a little bit.
So you select right later. That's all.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/472-1

01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:20.859
<v thomas broussard>I'm just saying I want to drop the whole

01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:12.510
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:42.670
<v thomas broussard>Yes. No, we have. We have. We have. Yeah.
So we think we look at the difference.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/493-0
01:04:09.350 --> 01:04:14.906

if you from here to recruit to me,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/493-1
01:04:14.906 --> 01:04:22.744
<v thomas broussard>what I would advise is every time you
have a script that is to create the good</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/493-2
01:04:22.744 --> 01:04:24.430
<v thomas broussard>that means right.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/496-0
01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:38.550
<v thomas broussard>Right? So then, actually,
don't think of this.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/497-0
01:04:40.310 --> 01:04:46.280
<v thomas broussard>Yes, so none connected to the .</v>

<v thomas broussard>See.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/499-0
01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:57.470
<v thomas broussard>Yep, and the next one you have to connect.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/500-0
01:04:59.470 --> 01:05:00.590
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:17.987
<v thomas broussard>OK,
so do you have any question regarding the</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/502-1
01:05:17.987 --> 01:05:25.418
<v thomas broussard>join? Do you see the the concept?
I think if you have understood why we do</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/502-2
01:05:25.418 --> 01:05:29.975
<v thomas broussard>links,
it's pretty easy to understand why now</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/502-3
01:05:29.975 --> 01:05:32.550
<v thomas broussard>it's a matter of practice.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/503-0
01:05:33.110 --> 01:05:38.865
<v thomas broussard>As usual,
you will not learn it without practice.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/503-1
01:05:38.865 --> 01:05:46.230
<v thomas broussard>So have you found 5 queries regarding the
collab data database?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/504-0
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:51.546
<v thomas broussard>That could be interesting.
So for instance,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/504-1
01:05:51.546 --> 01:05:56.918
<v thomas broussard>could be all the bookings with the
corresponding facility names.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/504-2
01:05:56.918 --> 01:06:00.719
<v thomas broussard>This is what we have here.
If we remove this,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/504-3
01:06:00.719 --> 01:06:02.950
<v thomas broussard>of course we need to limit.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/505-0
01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:06.630
<v thomas broussard>To a certain number.</v>

01:06:10.110 --> 01:06:14.990
<v thomas broussard>Because otherwise what happens if we do a
select star with no limits?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/507-0
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.550

01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:19.630

01:06:21.070 --> 01:06:27.334
<v thomas broussard>The whole table data that will be dumped.
OK, so that's why it's important.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/509-1
01:06:27.334 --> 01:06:33.598
<v thomas broussard>So here it's a left it's an inner join.
OK, what if I want to have as well?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/509-2
01:06:33.598 --> 01:06:36.070
<v thomas broussard>Not everything, but maybe the.</v>

01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:38.510
<v thomas broussard>Facility name.</v>

01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:52.630
<v thomas broussard>Facility name,
then the maybe the booking time.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/514-0
01:06:55.350 --> 01:06:59.150
<v thomas broussard>The facility name, the number of slots.</v>

01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:07.059
<v thomas broussard>And maybe we what could be interesting is
to have the members.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/515-1
01:07:07.059 --> 01:07:09.710
<v thomas broussard>How do I do to get the members?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/516-0
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:20.390
<v thomas broussard>What should I add here in order to get
the members as well?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/517-0
01:07:23.830 --> 01:07:29.750
<v thomas broussard>Hello. Someone is talking to you.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/518-0
01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:31.990
<v thomas broussard>Here we have.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/519-0
01:07:34.590 --> 01:07:35.070
<v thomas broussard>This.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/520-0
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:42.402
<v thomas broussard>We should have a inner join and next
another join.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/520-1
01:07:42.402 --> 01:07:46.910
<v thomas broussard>Actually can be inner join as well inner
join.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/521-0
01:07:49.350 --> 01:07:49.630

<v thomas broussard>On.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/523-0
01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:58.672
<v thomas broussard>And you see,
if you are patient for at least 200</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/523-1
01:07:58.672 --> 01:08:03.173
<v thomas broussard>milliseconds,
it will check if there's a primary key</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/523-2
01:08:03.173 --> 01:08:08.353
<v thomas broussard>that exists and the primary key and
foreign key that exists.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/523-3
01:08:08.353 --> 01:08:11.070
<v thomas broussard>It will propose this by default.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/524-0
01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:14.667
<v thomas broussard>OK,
so you don't even have to write if your</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/524-1
01:08:14.667 --> 01:08:19.774
<v thomas broussard>database constraints are correctly set up.
OK and what should it do here?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/524-2
01:08:19.774 --> 01:08:24.950
<v thomas broussard>Would it change the query if I do this?
Would it change the result timing?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/525-0
01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:29.310
<v thomas broussard>It will not change the result. Why?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/526-0
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:37.030
<v thomas broussard>Because I did not select anything else.
So here I need to select first name.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/527-0
01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:40.030
<v thomas broussard>And last name.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/530-0
01:08:53.350 --> 01:08:55.550
<v thomas broussard>OK, so here we know.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/531-0
01:08:59.190 --> 01:09:00.990
<v thomas broussard>We know exactly.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/532-0
01:09:03.230 --> 01:09:08.750
<v thomas broussard>Who has booked what at what time?
Give me another idea.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/537-0
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:36.710
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/539-0
01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:50.590
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/541-0
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:03.790
<v thomas broussard>Wait, you have a question?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/542-0
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:15.030
<v thomas broussard>No, exactly.
So you see here the question is.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/543-0
01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:26.121
<v thomas broussard>Do we have to always rename the table
name here to put an alias on it and then</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/543-1
01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:31.536
<v thomas broussard>to use this alias as prefix? No,
it's not always necessary,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/543-2
01:10:31.536 --> 01:10:36.590
<v thomas broussard>but this is only because we have in the
select at list.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/544-0
01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:40.930
<v thomas broussard>No ambiguity.
Here you see it's mandatory because we</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/544-1
01:10:40.930 --> 01:10:44.989
<v thomas broussard>need to to precise what column are we
talking about.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/544-2
01:10:44.989 --> 01:10:50.809
<v thomas broussard>Here this column is not the same as this
one, even if the name is the same.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/544-3
01:10:50.809 --> 01:10:53.030
<v thomas broussard>So in that case you would be.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/545-0
01:10:53.070 --> 01:10:58.714
<v thomas broussard>Forced to prefix at least by the table
name if you have no alias because the the</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/545-1
01:10:58.714 --> 01:11:03.451
<v thomas broussard>engine will say I don't know of what
column you are thinking about.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/545-2
01:11:03.451 --> 01:11:06.935
<v thomas broussard>It's ambiguous.
What about when like when you are</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/545-3
01:11:06.935 --> 01:11:07.910
<v thomas broussard>displaying it?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/547-0
01:11:08.150 --> 01:11:12.815
<v thomas broussard>Yeah, I you can as well.
So without doing as that's what you did</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/547-1
01:11:12.815 --> 01:11:18.341
<v thomas broussard>as refill first name and you just like
this everything to use the table name</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/547-2
01:11:18.341 --> 01:11:23.149
<v thomas broussard>automatically as a prefix when displaying
it, when it displays it.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/547-3
01:11:23.149 --> 01:11:27.670
<v thomas broussard>So instead of start time new first name,
I'm sorry let's call.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/548-0
01:11:27.790 --> 01:11:32.651
<v thomas broussard>Bookings dot start time.
You mean here you would like to have the</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/548-1
01:11:32.651 --> 01:11:38.321
<v thomas broussard>the prefix of the table? Yeah, no,
it's not possible to have it because here</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/548-2
01:11:38.321 --> 01:11:43.550
<v thomas broussard>it's something that does not exist.
It's only for for you to help. OK,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/548-3
01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:46.790
<v thomas broussard>if you really want to have B dot
something.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/549-0
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:51.350
<v thomas broussard>You have to have an eyes or simply like
this.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/550-0
01:11:58.710 --> 01:11:59.030
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/551-0
01:12:00.430 --> 01:12:06.546
<v thomas broussard>The as is implicit here. Yeah,
but usually this is not what we want.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/551-1
01:12:06.546 --> 01:12:12.839
<v thomas broussard>Now you have two two cases,
but actually it's a kind of the same case.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/551-2
01:12:12.839 --> 01:12:16.030
<v thomas broussard>It's normally you are doing a query.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/552-0
01:12:17.790 --> 01:12:21.190
<v thomas broussard>To feed some a part of the software.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/553-0
01:12:22.710 --> 01:12:27.464
<v thomas broussard>It can be a back end aspect,
so in that case what you need is</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/553-1
01:12:27.464 --> 01:12:31.297
<v thomas broussard>something which is unique and not so
presentable.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/553-2
01:12:31.297 --> 01:12:37.430
<v thomas broussard>You don't care about the presentation.
What comes here as long as it is unique.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/554-0
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:42.401
<v thomas broussard>And you can map it easily from your
software. You don't care.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/554-1
01:12:42.401 --> 01:12:47.906
<v thomas broussard>Sometimes you are doing a select query to
be directly presented in the user</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/554-2
01:12:47.906 --> 01:12:53.338
<v thomas broussard>interface by using for instance a
dashboard system or like I don't know if</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/554-3
01:12:53.338 --> 01:12:53.990
<v thomas broussard>you know.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/555-0
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:58.542
<v thomas broussard>Power BI or tools like this that do
dashboard from data.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/555-1
01:12:58.542 --> 01:13:03.113
<v thomas broussard>It's exactly the case here.
If you want to have something which</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/555-2
01:13:03.113 --> 01:13:08.470
<v thomas broussard>presents well from the beginning,
you will rename your columns directly at</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/555-3
01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:09.470
<v thomas broussard>the SQL level.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/556-0
01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:16.017
<v thomas broussard>But usually it's not the case because you
will have to aggregate with other data</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/556-1
01:13:16.017 --> 01:13:22.163
<v thomas broussard>and you will finally rename your view so
that it it is well looking for the user</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/556-2
01:13:22.163 --> 01:13:22.390
<v thomas broussard>so.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/557-0
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:31.190
<v thomas broussard>Usually you what you want really is
something which is unique here.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/558-0
01:13:35.190 --> 01:13:39.940
<v thomas broussard>OK, so we have this,
but we are a bit limited here.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/558-1
01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:44.780
<v thomas broussard>For instance,
if we want to have the user who is the</v>

01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.870
<v thomas broussard>How can I do?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/560-0
01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:57.510
<v thomas broussard>What? What data should I have?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/561-0
01:14:00.030 --> 01:14:06.041
<v thomas broussard>Yes, we need an aggregation. We need to.
Sorry,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/561-1
01:14:06.041 --> 01:14:14.430
<v thomas broussard>you see I'm getting old and a bit diff
maybe. So the question was.</v>

then if I have this I will be able to</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/564-1
01:14:36.684 --> 01:14:43.243
<v thomas broussard>identify who has booked the most in among
the members. Do you see the the approach?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/564-2
01:14:43.243 --> 01:14:49.333
<v thomas broussard>The problem is that here we we have a
count function. I did not introduce it,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/564-3
01:14:49.333 --> 01:14:50.270
<v thomas broussard>but we have.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/565-0
01:14:50.350 --> 01:14:54.813
<v thomas broussard>The count function,
but we'd like to have a count function</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/565-1
01:14:54.813 --> 01:14:59.276
<v thomas broussard>per member, per booking,
per members booking actually. OK,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/565-2
01:14:59.276 --> 01:15:05.176
<v thomas broussard>so we need to have the bookings for one
member and then to count specifically</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/565-3
01:15:05.176 --> 01:15:06.310
<v thomas broussard>those bookings.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/566-0
01:15:06.510 --> 01:15:10.310
<v thomas broussard>This is where we are missing some some
tools here.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/567-0
01:15:17.190 --> 01:15:17.350
<v thomas broussard>Sure.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/568-0
01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:26.070
<v thomas broussard>And this is if you want to.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/569-0
01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:30.884
<v thomas broussard>This if you want to do the few previous
slides,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/569-1
01:15:30.884 --> 01:15:37.080
<v thomas broussard>if it's if you want to connect to some
programming languages before we go for</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/569-2
01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:43.118
<v thomas broussard>the for the aggregate functions etc.
Just a small introduction to the other</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/569-3
01:15:43.118 --> 01:15:44.230
<v thomas broussard>SQL functions.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/570-0
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:49.585
<v thomas broussard>So we have concat.
If you want to concatenate strings,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/570-1
01:15:49.585 --> 01:15:54.257
<v thomas broussard>for instance in the to calculate the the
display name of a member,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/570-2
01:15:54.257 --> 01:15:59.138
<v thomas broussard>you could concatenate first name plus
surname within the same column.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/570-3
01:15:59.138 --> 01:16:00.950
<v thomas broussard>So it will look like this.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/571-0
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:03.550
<v thomas broussard>Just to let you know.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/572-0
01:16:09.630 --> 01:16:09.830
<v thomas broussard>It.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/573-0
01:16:11.710 --> 01:16:13.750
<v thomas broussard>Maybe just with her.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/574-0
01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:16.590
<v thomas broussard>Separate all space in between.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/575-0
01:16:19.150 --> 01:16:27.476
<v thomas broussard>Here we can have as display name. OK,
so it merges joins, strings.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/575-1
01:16:27.476 --> 01:16:34.310
<v thomas broussard>Concat could be called joins as well,
but join string.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/576-0
01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:40.732
<v thomas broussard>Upper lower case to transform the the the
results,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/576-1
01:16:40.732 --> 01:16:45.036
<v thomas broussard>the values to their corresponding upper
lower case.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/576-2
01:16:45.036 --> 01:16:49.506
<v thomas broussard>A substring to extract a string from a
bigger string,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/576-3
01:16:49.506 --> 01:16:53.230
<v thomas broussard>the length which is the size of of the
text.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/577-0
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:58.820
<v thomas broussard>Then date and date functions we have.
Now we have code dates,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/577-1
01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:03.104
<v thomas broussard>we have current date is the current date
without time.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/577-2
01:17:03.104 --> 01:17:08.790
<v thomas broussard>Date add is when you want to add some
interval to have for instance the.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/578-0
01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:17.342
<v thomas broussard>Bookings within the two last weeks you
could have date adds -14 and between now</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/578-1
01:17:17.342 --> 01:17:24.704
<v thomas broussard>and this stage the date diff to compute
the difference in term in terms of of</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/578-2
01:17:24.704 --> 01:17:25.270
<v thomas broussard>dates.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/579-0
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:31.758
<v thomas broussard>Principally to see if a date is before
and after and here we have the the</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/579-1
01:17:31.758 --> 01:17:35.736
<v thomas broussard>components,
the date components extraction year,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/579-2
01:17:35.736 --> 01:17:41.743
<v thomas broussard>month and day. OK, so here year,
month and day it's to have only the date</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/579-3
01:17:41.743 --> 01:17:42.230
<v thomas broussard>parts.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/580-0
01:17:42.670 --> 01:17:45.190
<v thomas broussard>For instance,
it can be interesting to see.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/581-0
01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:53.910
<v thomas broussard>Here you see that we have some dates here
you can have.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/582-0
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:06.474
<v thomas broussard>yeah only the year of the daytime,
then only the month.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/582-1
01:18:06.474 --> 01:18:10.110
<v thomas broussard>Of course it has no meaning, but</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/583-0
01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:16.148
<v thomas broussard>It could be interesting to extract the
month to see if there's a seasonality in</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/583-1
01:18:16.148 --> 01:18:19.448
<v thomas broussard>our bookings for a specific facility.
For instance,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/583-2
01:18:19.448 --> 01:18:22.748
<v thomas broussard>the tennis court may be booked a lot
during summer,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/583-3
01:18:22.748 --> 01:18:27.190
<v thomas broussard>but not a lot during winter,
so that could be interesting to observe.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/584-0
01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:35.430
<v thomas broussard>OK, so these are the date components,
but now let's try to go back to our.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/585-0
01:18:40.830 --> 01:18:45.730
<v thomas broussard>Aggregate functions.
If we want to have bigger statistics,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/585-1
01:18:45.730 --> 01:18:49.800
<v thomas broussard>I mean volume statistics on the on the
data set,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/585-2
01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:56.277
<v thomas broussard>we need to have what we call aggregate
functions. Count is the first of them,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/585-3
01:18:56.277 --> 01:18:58.270
<v thomas broussard>so we can have the idea.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/586-0
01:18:58.350 --> 01:19:04.081
<v thomas broussard>Usually when it's when you import things,
you do a count to make sure that you have</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/586-1
01:19:04.081 --> 01:19:08.310
<v thomas broussard>the correct number of rules.
So here we can do select counts.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/587-0
01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:12.390
<v thomas broussard>From members.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/588-0
01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:18.190
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/589-0
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:27.510
<v thomas broussard>You see that we can count one or count
star as well. What's the difference?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/590-0
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:34.632
<v thomas broussard>What? What means this one?
What if I do 3 here changes? Nothing.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/590-1
01:19:34.632 --> 01:19:37.110
<v thomas broussard>It's actually not the increments.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/591-0
01:19:38.230 --> 01:19:44.612
<v thomas broussard>It's actually the column number.
So here you are counting the third column</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/591-1
01:19:44.612 --> 01:19:48.526
<v thomas broussard>from members here the entries in this
column.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/591-2
01:19:48.526 --> 01:19:52.950
<v thomas broussard>So the count applies on one column if you
do start.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/592-0
01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:59.110
<v thomas broussard>It expands the whole list of columns that
you have for one row.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/593-0
01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:05.632
<v thomas broussard>Which is not good because actually you
need only one column to to make your</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/593-1
01:20:05.632 --> 01:20:09.556
<v thomas broussard>counts. OK,
what is interesting for you is the number</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/593-2
01:20:09.556 --> 01:20:12.971
<v thomas broussard>of rows.
So normally if you have a rectangular</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/593-3
01:20:12.971 --> 01:20:15.150
<v thomas broussard>table, which is our case here.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/594-0
01:20:15.790 --> 01:20:20.529
<v thomas broussard>If you count column one, column two,
column three or all the columns,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/594-1
01:20:20.529 --> 01:20:25.877
<v thomas broussard>it will still be a row. So it's one row,
whatever is the number of columns you</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/594-2
01:20:25.877 --> 01:20:29.735
<v thomas broussard>have expanded.
Why am I forcing one here to make sure we</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/594-3
01:20:29.735 --> 01:20:32.510
<v thomas broussard>are not expanding the whole columns data?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/595-0
01:20:32.670 --> 01:20:40.870
<v thomas broussard>To only do the counts of the room. OK,
you can only go first. Yep, exactly. Yeah.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/596-0
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:47.305
<v thomas broussard>OK, so here's the counts.
So you see how to apply this.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/596-1
01:20:47.305 --> 01:20:49.070
<v thomas broussard>It's a bit weird because.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/597-0
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:54.430
<v thomas broussard>Beforehand we had a result which look
like this, so it's a table.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/598-0
01:20:54.630 --> 01:20:55.350
<v thomas broussard>So it's a table.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/601-0
01:20:56.790 --> 01:21:03.839
<v thomas broussard>Here the result is a very specific table.
It's a table with one column and one row</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/601-1
01:21:03.839 --> 01:21:10.972
<v thomas broussard>on. This is why it's called an aggregate,
because we are aggregating a list of data</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/601-2
01:21:10.972 --> 01:21:12.670
<v thomas broussard>to one single value.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/602-0
01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:12.990
<v thomas broussard>Value.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/603-0
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:18.073
<v thomas broussard>OK,
so when you see that it's always it can</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/603-1
01:21:18.073 --> 01:21:24.381
<v thomas broussard>sometimes be called aggregation and
sometimes it can be called as well a</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/603-2
01:21:24.381 --> 01:21:28.961
<v thomas broussard>reduction.
Maybe you have seen in the literature map</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/603-3
01:21:28.961 --> 01:21:30.430
<v thomas broussard>reduce operation.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/604-0
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:37.181
<v thomas broussard>Here we are doing a reduction.
We are reducing the data set to a single</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/604-1
01:21:37.181 --> 01:21:37.990
<v thomas broussard>value. OK.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/605-0
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:40.150
<v thomas broussard>It.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/606-0
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:46.521
<v thomas broussard>So we have other functions like AVG.
For instance,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/606-1
01:21:46.521 --> 01:21:52.109
<v thomas broussard>if we want to see the average number of
slots which which is booked,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/606-2
01:21:52.109 --> 01:21:56.078
<v thomas broussard>median percentiles,
actually all the statistics,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/606-3
01:21:56.078 --> 01:21:58.750
<v thomas broussard>statistical data we have as well.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/607-0
01:21:58.950 --> 01:22:01.030
<v thomas broussard>We can determine partitions.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/609-0
01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:07.004
<v thomas broussard>Based on some criteria and that will
allow us to do some counts or some</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/609-1
01:22:07.004 --> 01:22:10.626
<v thomas broussard>aggregates per partition of the data.
For instance,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/609-2
01:22:10.626 --> 01:22:16.127
<v thomas broussard>if you remember I said I would like to
counts per member per different member.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/609-3
01:22:16.127 --> 01:22:21.350
<v thomas broussard>We can do a partition over the member ID,
so we have a subset of the data.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/610-0
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:26.310
<v thomas broussard>Data only for that member and then we can
do a specific count only for that guy.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/612-0
01:22:29.230 --> 01:22:35.230
<v thomas broussard>So let's have a look here to the Select
Counts aspect.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/613-0
01:22:36.630 --> 01:22:42.277
<v thomas broussard>You can also apply where clauses,
so it's like a usual query.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/613-1
01:22:42.277 --> 01:22:47.833
<v thomas broussard>So if you want to filter you will have a
another result. OK,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/613-2
01:22:47.833 --> 01:22:54.482
<v thomas broussard>you see that it works as well.
In order to to have stable result we need</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/613-3
01:22:54.482 --> 01:22:56.030
<v thomas broussard>to have order by.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/614-0
01:22:56.390 --> 01:23:01.969
<v thomas broussard>And run cover we'll see in the next in
the next session.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/614-1
01:23:01.969 --> 01:23:08.134
<v thomas broussard>The order by here allows you to fix an
order for your results.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/614-2
01:23:08.134 --> 01:23:11.070
<v thomas broussard>Have a look here we have this.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/615-0
01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:14.350
<v thomas broussard>Let's maybe do this.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/617-0
01:23:18.150 --> 01:23:20.070
<v thomas broussard>If you do that for the exam.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/618-0
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:22.910
<v thomas broussard>You are doomed.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/619-0
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:30.390
<v thomas broussard>Because you have no order and even in
real life, I mean if you do that,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/619-1
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:35.077
<v thomas broussard>you are not good because if you have here
a limit of 10,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/619-2
01:23:35.077 --> 01:23:39.270
<v thomas broussard>you are taking randomly 10 entries from
the table.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/620-0
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:45.453
<v thomas broussard>Which is not good if you want to do
search, if you want to do pagination,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/620-1
01:23:45.453 --> 01:23:50.142
<v thomas broussard>if you want to do filtering, etcetera,
you you it's not stable.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/620-2
01:23:50.142 --> 01:23:54.831
<v thomas broussard>How to make it stable?
You are forced to add an order by close,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/620-3
01:23:54.831 --> 01:23:56.150
<v thomas broussard>order by and then.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/621-0
01:23:56.230 --> 01:24:00.510
<v thomas broussard>Usually we use functional data,
so here apparently we are counting.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/623-0
01:24:04.230 --> 01:24:09.101
<v thomas broussard>We are not counting,
but we can display what can be interested</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/623-1
01:24:09.101 --> 01:24:11.110
<v thomas broussard>is the list of facilities.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/625-0
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:14.830
<v thomas broussard>Maybe it could be by dates.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/626-0
01:24:18.630 --> 01:24:22.614
<v thomas broussard>It's not date, it's start time,
start time desk.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/626-1
01:24:22.614 --> 01:24:28.955
<v thomas broussard>So here I will have the most recent
bookings first and then I can also change</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/626-2
01:24:28.955 --> 01:24:34.158
<v thomas broussard>with the facility name.
So if we have something which is booked</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/626-3
01:24:34.158 --> 01:24:36.190
<v thomas broussard>exactly at the same time.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/627-0
01:24:36.630 --> 01:24:40.590
<v thomas broussard>We can do then an order within that
subgroup.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/628-0
01:24:47.110 --> 01:24:49.230
<v thomas broussard>Look at the results here, it will change.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/630-0
01:24:50.710 --> 01:24:54.074
<v thomas broussard>For sure,
because now we are booking by this.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/630-1
01:24:54.074 --> 01:24:57.950
<v thomas broussard>Let's just remove this because it's a bit
troubling.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/631-0
01:25:00.990 --> 01:25:01.230
<v thomas broussard>Right.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/632-0
01:25:02.270 --> 01:25:02.390
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/633-0
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:12.337
<v thomas broussard>So here we have the latest bookings and
then if we have something which is at the</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/633-1
01:25:12.337 --> 01:25:17.644
<v thomas broussard>same date and time,
you see it's the case here. What do we do?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/633-2
01:25:17.644 --> 01:25:21.350
<v thomas broussard>We organize,
we order by the facility name.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/634-0
01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:25.930
<v thomas broussard>And we see that here we have an equality
as well.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/634-1
01:25:25.930 --> 01:25:30.190
<v thomas broussard>So in order to make it 100% stable,
we can order by.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/635-0
01:25:40.230 --> 01:25:45.070
<v thomas broussard>And so we are sure that what we see here
is always in the same order.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/636-0
01:25:46.630 --> 01:25:52.060
<v thomas broussard>It's super important because all the
pagination you would like to implement,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/636-1
01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:57.490
<v thomas broussard>all the filtering you'd like to implement.
If you don't have an order at the</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/636-2
01:25:57.490 --> 01:26:00.310
<v thomas broussard>beginning, it will not work as properly.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/638-0
01:26:01.870 --> 01:26:06.625
<v thomas broussard>And here I'm talking about the
application from the application point of</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/638-1
01:26:06.625 --> 01:26:06.950
<v thomas broussard>view.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/639-0
01:26:09.150 --> 01:26:10.430
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/640-0
01:26:11.950 --> 01:26:13.590
<v thomas broussard>Um, OK.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/641-0
01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:18.230
<v thomas broussard>What is the difference between order by?
Oops.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/642-0
01:26:21.390 --> 01:26:22.910
<v thomas broussard>And rank over.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/645-0
01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:43.710
<v thomas broussard>Just classified which, which, yeah.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/646-0
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:50.906
<v thomas broussard>Usually the common problem that you will
have with business analysts and business</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/646-1
01:26:50.906 --> 01:26:55.028
<v thomas broussard>representatives,
user representatives is that they will</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/646-2
01:26:55.028 --> 01:27:00.990
<v thomas broussard>come to you with a question like I would
like to to see the top three countries.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/647-0
01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:06.889
<v thomas broussard>For that count or for that statistic,
and actually the top three is very</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/647-1
01:27:06.889 --> 01:27:10.910
<v thomas broussard>difficult to achieve because if you have
inequality.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/648-0
01:27:12.510 --> 01:27:17.874
<v thomas broussard>It's a mess. For instance,
if you have 10 countries which have</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/648-1
01:27:17.874 --> 01:27:22.642
<v thomas broussard>exactly the same stats,
how do you make the the choice?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/648-2
01:27:22.642 --> 01:27:27.750
<v thomas broussard>So the question which is behind is maybe
not the top three.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/649-0
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:34.348
<v thomas broussard>But the countries at rank three,
up to rank three, you see the point?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/649-1
01:27:34.348 --> 01:27:40.945
<v thomas broussard>It's like in the competition.
Imagine that you have a car competition</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/649-2
01:27:40.945 --> 01:27:42.830
<v thomas broussard>and 10 cars arrives.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/650-0
01:27:43.350 --> 01:27:48.963
<v thomas broussard>In the first three places,
how do you determine who will step up on</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/650-1
01:27:48.963 --> 01:27:49.870
<v thomas broussard>the podium?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/651-0
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:55.222
<v thomas broussard>You see,
it's not fair if you give by name,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/651-1
01:27:55.222 --> 01:27:59.513
<v thomas broussard>if you give off,
if you take randomly for the 3rd place,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/651-2
01:27:59.513 --> 01:28:03.352
<v thomas broussard>all the remaining piece per person,
it's not fair.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/651-3
01:28:03.352 --> 01:28:08.470
<v thomas broussard>So what is done in competition usually is
that we have an equality.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/652-0
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:14.520
<v thomas broussard>Between all the three, the step,
the wrong three.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/652-1
01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:17.910
<v thomas broussard>Let's me give an example here.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/653-0
01:28:19.670 --> 01:28:19.790
<v thomas broussard>Um.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/654-0
01:28:25.150 --> 01:28:35.430
<v thomas broussard>Let's try to organize by join date.
Select star. Let's take from facilities.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/655-0
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:38.870

01:28:40.230 --> 01:28:43.350
<v thomas broussard>Member cost listen.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/657-0
01:28:46.830 --> 01:28:48.510
<v thomas broussard>It's typical here.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/658-0
01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:59.215
<v thomas broussard>Here I would like you to give me the top
three facilities regarding the member</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/658-1
01:28:59.215 --> 01:28:59.550
<v thomas broussard>cost.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/659-0
01:29:06.030 --> 01:29:06.950
<v thomas broussard>What does that mean?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/660-0
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:16.230
<v thomas broussard>Okay, the the top, the cheapest,
the three cheapest uh facilities.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/661-0
01:29:17.190 --> 01:29:18.710
<v thomas broussard>Regarding the member cost.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/662-0
01:29:20.830 --> 01:29:20.870
<v thomas broussard>Oh.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/663-0
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:29.190
<v thomas broussard>There are four because member cost here
we see that we have 4% for facilities</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/663-1
01:29:29.190 --> 01:29:35.510
<v thomas broussard>which are which are having member cost 0.
How do you give the top three then?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/664-0
01:29:36.710 --> 01:29:41.710
<v thomas broussard>I can tell you the first reflex of a
software engineer is to say OK.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/665-0
01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:52.145
<v thomas broussard>I will do ask and as what is asked is to
do to have the top three,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/665-1
01:29:52.145 --> 01:29:57.070
<v thomas broussard>we limit three and boom,
we have the top three.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/666-0
01:29:59.790 --> 01:30:01.710
<v thomas broussard>No, have a look.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/669-0
01:30:21.790 --> 01:30:29.724
<v thomas broussard>I've just organized by name now and it's
not the same result as before O my top</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/669-1
01:30:29.724 --> 01:30:31.310
<v thomas broussard>three has moved.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/670-0
01:30:33.870 --> 01:30:34.790
<v thomas broussard>It's not good.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/671-0
01:30:35.550 --> 01:30:39.510
<v thomas broussard>Not good at all.
What means that I need to have another</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/671-1
01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:45.521
<v thomas broussard>way to sort and to organize my top three?
Maybe I should tell the business analysts.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/671-2
01:30:45.521 --> 01:30:50.470
<v thomas broussard>Yes, but top three is not good.
What you want is not top three, it's.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/672-0
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:57.539
<v thomas broussard>The cost at rank 3 maybe.
So how do you compute the rank?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/672-1
01:30:57.539 --> 01:31:00.430
<v thomas broussard>This will form rank one.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/673-0
01:31:01.230 --> 01:31:01.390
<v thomas broussard>1.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/675-0
01:31:03.550 --> 01:31:08.241
<v thomas broussard>And then you have two or three other ways
to calculate the rank.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/675-1
01:31:08.241 --> 01:31:12.138
<v thomas broussard>You have the dense rank and you have the
sparse rank.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/675-2
01:31:12.138 --> 01:31:17.405
<v thomas broussard>If you use the sparse rank here,
you will move directly from rank one to</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/675-3
01:31:17.405 --> 01:31:17.910
<v thomas broussard>rank 4.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/676-0
01:31:18.030 --> 01:31:22.470
<v thomas broussard>And then five and then six, et cetera.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/678-0
01:31:24.670 --> 01:31:28.022
<v thomas broussard>You see,
we'll see that a bit later in detail,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/678-1
01:31:28.022 --> 01:31:32.515
<v thomas broussard>I mean for the rank,
but it's only to explain that usually the</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/678-2
01:31:32.515 --> 01:31:38.434
<v thomas broussard>top three something is very difficult to
compute and this is why we need to have a</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/678-3
01:31:38.434 --> 01:31:38.790
<v thomas broussard>rank.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/679-0
01:31:40.190 --> 01:31:43.510
<v thomas broussard>Good. So let's talk about the rank later.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/680-0
01:31:44.590 --> 01:31:47.310
<v thomas broussard>The other buy is like this.
You have seen it in action.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/681-0
01:31:48.990 --> 01:31:56.338
<v thomas broussard>Now let's try to have if you remember the
aggregate function that we are were</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/681-1
01:31:56.338 --> 01:32:01.519
<v thomas broussard>talking about.
Now we can have this aggregate function</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/681-2
01:32:01.519 --> 01:32:04.910
<v thomas broussard>applied pair group. How do we group?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/682-0
01:32:05.230 --> 01:32:07.310
<v thomas broussard>We have to have common things.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/683-0
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:13.190
<v thomas broussard>Here I can tell you it tries to count the
booking per member.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/684-0
01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:19.509
<v thomas broussard>How do you do that if you have no
database?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/684-1
01:32:19.509 --> 01:32:21.990
<v thomas broussard>I give you an Excel with all the bookings.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/685-0
01:32:23.790 --> 01:32:29.265
<v thomas broussard>And you don't know the crosstab.
You don't know the crosstab that allows</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/685-1
01:32:29.265 --> 01:32:34.590
<v thomas broussard>you to group by counts, etc.
How do you do to to first find the groups</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/685-2
01:32:34.590 --> 01:32:35.790
<v thomas broussard>pair member IDs?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/686-0
01:32:40.350 --> 01:32:45.710
<v thomas broussard>I give you a rule list of bookings.
Inside there's the start time,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/686-1
01:32:45.710 --> 01:32:48.830
<v thomas broussard>there's the member ID, the facility ID.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/687-0
01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:54.150
<v thomas broussard>How do you find manually?
I mean the groups.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/688-0
01:32:56.110 --> 01:32:57.110
<v thomas broussard>Of members.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/691-0
01:33:08.710 --> 01:33:14.710
<v thomas broussard>All the by, yeah,
let's do a select star from bookings.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/692-0
01:33:18.590 --> 01:33:24.139
<v thomas broussard>Looks like this.
You see we have member IDs with a lot of</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/692-1
01:33:24.139 --> 01:33:27.870
<v thomas broussard>different values. Now if I do order by.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/693-0
01:33:30.510 --> 01:33:32.390
<v thomas broussard>Member ID descending.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/694-0
01:33:33.950 --> 01:33:36.470
<v thomas broussard>What do I see here? Groups.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/695-0
01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:42.362
<v thomas broussard>The seven first rows are for the member
ID 36.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/695-1
01:33:42.362 --> 01:33:49.434
<v thomas broussard>The following rows are for member ID 35,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/695-2
01:33:49.434 --> 01:33:53.830
<v thomas broussard>You see the point.
So here we see the groups.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/697-0
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:59.488
<v thomas broussard>The only thing is that we don't want to
do the groups ourselves.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/697-1
01:33:59.488 --> 01:34:04.036
<v thomas broussard>We want to the engine to find the group.
So how do we do?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/697-2
01:34:04.036 --> 01:34:08.270
<v thomas broussard>If we want to to achieve that,
we will do a group by.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/699-0
01:34:20.630 --> 01:34:23.950
<v thomas broussard>And it deends what you want to alley then
on this.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/702-0
01:34:32.830 --> 01:34:37.387
<v thomas broussard>What do you want to know for that member?
Usually what we want at first is the</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/702-1
01:34:37.387 --> 01:34:37.790
<v thomas broussard>counts.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/705-0
01:34:46.990 --> 01:34:53.854
<v thomas broussard>OK, you see here that we are,
we are having the count of the bookings</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/705-1
01:34:53.854 --> 01:34:55.030
<v thomas broussard>pair member.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/706-0
01:34:56.670 --> 01:35:00.058
<v thomas broussard>It's only that here it's not a usual
source.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/706-1
01:35:00.058 --> 01:35:06.156
<v thomas broussard>It's not a unexpected source that we have,
because usually when we count things,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/706-2
01:35:06.156 --> 01:35:09.469
<v thomas broussard>it's to organize by counts and not pair
ID.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/706-3
01:35:09.469 --> 01:35:12.630
<v thomas broussard>So what we do here is more likely to have.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/707-0
01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:19.590
<v thomas broussard>The top booking members.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/708-0
01:35:22.350 --> 01:35:28.709
<v thomas broussard>The here what we see here is the count of
bookings per member.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/708-1
01:35:28.709 --> 01:35:35.976
<v thomas broussard>It's here select the member ID.
For each member ID you count the number</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/708-2
01:35:35.976 --> 01:35:39.710
<v thomas broussard>of rows associated to this member ID.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/709-0
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:44.395
<v thomas broussard>How do we,
how is it possible to have at the same</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/709-1
01:35:44.395 --> 01:35:50.914
<v thomas broussard>time an aggregate and a column?
It's because we have made a group and you</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/709-2
01:35:50.914 --> 01:35:55.230
<v thomas broussard>see here what is here.
I call it the group, the.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/710-0
01:35:55.350 --> 01:36:00.222
<v thomas broussard>Group title. This is the group title.
We have set this to be the group title.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/710-1
01:36:00.222 --> 01:36:02.470
<v thomas broussard>If I want, I can give another title.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/711-0
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:09.830
<v thomas broussard>I can group by name, by surname,
by surname, plus last, plus first name,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/711-1
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:11.110
<v thomas broussard>for instance, yeah.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/712-0
01:36:13.390 --> 01:36:14.790
<v thomas broussard>Do you see the the approach?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/713-0
01:36:16.150 --> 01:36:19.950
<v thomas broussard>Do you see how we have?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/714-0
01:36:22.030 --> 01:36:26.981
<v thomas broussard>We have used a group by here to determine
partitions,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/714-1
01:36:26.981 --> 01:36:34.223
<v thomas broussard>groups of data within the main table.
So we have extracted groups and for each</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/714-2
01:36:34.223 --> 01:36:36.790
<v thomas broussard>group we apply an aggregate.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/715-0
01:36:38.270 --> 01:36:43.270
<v thomas broussard>It can be as well, not the content.
It can be for instance.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/716-0
01:36:50.590 --> 01:36:56.710
<v thomas broussard>Usually when a member books something,
what's the average duration it is taking?</v>

01:37:00.910 --> 01:37:02.990
<v thomas broussard>So here we see that.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/718-0
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:11.190
<v thomas broussard>0 means guest and usually those persons
guest are looking for three slots,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/718-1
01:37:11.190 --> 01:37:12.750
<v thomas broussard>almost three slots.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/719-0
01:37:14.110 --> 01:37:14.790
<v thomas broussard>In average.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/720-0
01:37:16.190 --> 01:37:19.401
<v thomas broussard>Of course,
that could be interesting to group by</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/720-1
01:37:19.401 --> 01:37:24.185
<v thomas broussard>member and then group by facility ID to
see per member and per facility.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/720-2
01:37:24.185 --> 01:37:26.150
<v thomas broussard>What's the average of looking?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/721-0
01:37:27.150 --> 01:37:30.378
<v thomas broussard>See.
So we'll go again on that point next time</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/721-1
01:37:30.378 --> 01:37:33.881
<v thomas broussard>and of course we'll do the we'll do the
data comp.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/721-2
01:37:33.881 --> 01:37:36.972
<v thomas broussard>So next time we'll do the data comp as
well.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/721-3
01:37:36.972 --> 01:37:41.230
<v thomas broussard>Once the data comp is I provide you with
an unknown database.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/722-0
01:37:42.270 --> 01:37:46.449
<v thomas broussard>And we do like in the exam I ask you
functional questions.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/722-1
01:37:46.449 --> 01:37:52.257
<v thomas broussard>You have to extract data and that will be
the occasion to practice again to group</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/722-2
01:37:52.257 --> 01:37:54.310
<v thomas broussard>by and the rank over as well.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/723-0
01:37:56.670 --> 01:37:58.470
<v thomas broussard>Let me share with you.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/724-0
01:38:01.190 --> 01:38:03.270
<v thomas broussard>Data extraction.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/737-0
01:39:13.190 --> 01:39:13.870
<v thomas broussard>OK, guys.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/738-0
01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:19.187
<v thomas broussard>So for next time, if I were you,
what would I do?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/738-1
01:39:19.187 --> 01:39:22.212
<v thomas broussard>I would redo with you the the lectures.
OK,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/738-2
01:39:22.212 --> 01:39:25.030
<v thomas broussard>maybe I did not share with you lecture 4.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/739-0
01:39:35.950 --> 01:39:40.390
<v thomas broussard>OK, so the lecture three and four,
the joints.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/740-0
01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:46.477
<v thomas broussard>The review the what we have in the data
extraction dot SQL and do your</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/740-1
01:39:46.477 --> 01:39:49.917
<v thomas broussard>pgexercises.com.
Normally you have almost all of the</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/740-2
01:39:49.917 --> 01:39:53.550
<v thomas broussard>theoretical material which is necessary
to practice it.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/740-3

01:39:58.190 --> 01:40:03.081
<v thomas broussard>Between now and next time you will be
like super sharp for the data pump,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/741-1
01:40:03.081 --> 01:40:05.790

01:43:17.790 --> 01:43:23.590
<v thomas broussard>So let's see if you have a.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/786-0
01:43:25.390 --> 01:43:30.439
<v thomas broussard>And you let's say join and because you
not join and you want to that's the first</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/786-1
01:43:30.439 --> 01:43:35.487
<v thomas broussard>thing you want to use that the another
query you have to write it on because I'm</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/786-2
01:43:35.487 --> 01:43:38.852
<v thomas broussard>not to do something like you can see 80
or something.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/786-3
01:43:38.852 --> 01:43:43.900
<v thomas broussard>I don't know if you do that you can do
two things either you will name it within</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/786-4
01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:44.710
<v thomas broussard>the parallel.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/787-0
01:43:44.710 --> 01:43:50.680
<v thomas broussard>Something and then you can do whatever
you want as a table or in some some</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/787-1
01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:55.218
<v thomas broussard>database engines you can create virtual
tables. Well OK,</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/787-2
01:43:55.218 --> 01:44:00.630
<v thomas broussard>that's what it's using views, views, yeah,
but it's only for query.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/791-0
01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:06.901
<v thomas broussard>Not only not for for instance, yeah,
just for a query like I'm optimizing so I</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/791-1
01:44:06.901 --> 01:44:13.068
<v thomas broussard>don't have to if you are doing always the
same thing like if you want the students</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/791-2
01:44:13.068 --> 01:44:18.121
<v thomas broussard>and the attendants you are doing this
always you can create a view.</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/791-3
01:44:18.121 --> 01:44:20.870
<v thomas broussard>Can you can you try an example maybe?</v>

2ae56c84-ee58-44e2-affa-aaa961767d51/792-0
