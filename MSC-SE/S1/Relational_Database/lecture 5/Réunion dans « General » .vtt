00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:23.026
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/9-0
00:00:44.306 --> 00:00:44.786
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/14-0
00:01:21.026 --> 00:01:22.066
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/17-0
00:01:39.226 --> 00:01:39.706
<v thomas broussard>Mhm.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/19-0
00:01:43.826 --> 00:01:51.729
<v thomas broussard>So last time we have started exercises on
this. Today we'll continue. OK,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/19-1
00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.146
<v thomas broussard>we'll progress through this and.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/20-0
00:01:56.106 --> 00:02:01.087
<v thomas broussard>Let's say we do a 5 questions per 15
minutes maximum. OK,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/20-1
00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:07.441
<v thomas broussard>except if you are all done before that
and then we I show the correction,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/20-2
00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:11.906
<v thomas broussard>we bring the queries together and then we
go ahead.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/21-0
00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.386
<v thomas broussard>Oh, on this.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/23-0
00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:26.666
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/26-0
00:02:44.386 --> 00:02:49.866
<v thomas broussard>So I can't remember what we have done
last time.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/27-0
00:02:55.226 --> 00:03:04.586
<v thomas broussard>Probably I saved nothing last time. OK,
can you remember to what query where?</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/28-0
00:03:10.306 --> 00:03:11.306
<v thomas broussard>Please be stopped out.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/29-0
00:03:12.586 --> 00:03:18.066
<v thomas broussard>5-5 it's not that Friday. OK,
maybe we haven't on the log.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/32-0
00:03:24.826 --> 00:03:29.207
<v thomas broussard>So let's, uh, we did five. We did five.
OK,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/32-1
00:03:29.207 --> 00:03:34.186
<v thomas broussard>so let's just start again from 5:00 and
let's do.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/33-0
00:03:37.946 --> 00:03:43.980
<v thomas broussard>I repeat on this is a good opportunity
for you to practice with me next to you</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/33-1
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.243
<v thomas broussard>and we can explain again things that you
that you think you have missed etcetera.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/33-2
00:03:50.243 --> 00:03:53.986
<v thomas broussard>So how to get the revenue for one
specific year?</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/34-0
00:03:55.466 --> 00:04:00.106
<v thomas broussard>I record on for the mojo for this kind of
exercise.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/35-0
00:04:02.186 --> 00:04:06.488
<v thomas broussard>It's important to have the diagram.
If you don't have the diagram,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/35-1
00:04:06.488 --> 00:04:11.496
<v thomas broussard>it's super difficult because you will
have to look at all the tables, module,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/35-2
00:04:11.496 --> 00:04:15.477
<v thomas broussard>all the tables, etcetera manually.
So that's super difficult.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/35-3
00:04:15.477 --> 00:04:19.137
<v thomas broussard>Better to have the diagram to navigate
through the data.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/35-4
00:04:19.137 --> 00:04:22.026
<v thomas broussard>And here we instantly see that in the
other.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/36-0
00:04:22.026 --> 00:04:27.830
<v thomas broussard>Details we have unit price, quantity,
discounts and here we have the</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/36-1
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:34.307
<v thomas broussard>constraints of having the time of the
order and here we have the shipped the</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/36-2
00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:39.186
<v thomas broussard>sorry the order date somewhere but not in
the same table.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/37-0
00:04:40.866 --> 00:04:45.346
<v thomas broussard>So when you have data distributed over
different tables, it's the case for.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/38-0
00:04:48.986 --> 00:04:54.266
<v thomas broussard>When you want to fetch data from
different tables, you need to use.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/39-0
00:04:56.186 --> 00:04:56.546
<v thomas broussard>The.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/40-0
00:04:58.186 --> 00:04:59.706
<v thomas broussard>Operator.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/41-0
00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:09.269
<v thomas broussard>How to query data from different tables
guys? Join. Join. Yes. OK, so we can join.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/41-1
00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:13.310
<v thomas broussard>We can see that there's a link between
those two tables.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/41-2
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.626
<v thomas broussard>Is that a problem if we don't have any
link visible here? Is it a problem?</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/43-0
00:05:18.986 --> 00:05:23.811
<v thomas broussard>It is. It can be a problem,
but it's not mandatory to have a link</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/43-1
00:05:23.811 --> 00:05:29.585
<v thomas broussard>between 2 tables to join data from 2
tables. It's a bit weird not to say that,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/43-2
00:05:29.585 --> 00:05:35.506
<v thomas broussard>but actually the join does doesn't care
about the foreign keys and primary keys.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/44-0
00:05:36.026 --> 00:05:43.564
<v thomas broussard>It it cares only about the criteria you
are giving in order to set up the join</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/44-1
00:05:43.564 --> 00:05:48.717
<v thomas broussard>operation.
So you can join 2 tables without any link,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/44-2
00:05:48.717 --> 00:05:51.866
<v thomas broussard>providing the fact that you have.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/45-0
00:05:51.866 --> 00:05:58.584
<v thomas broussard>A valid matching condition understood and
valid in terms of technique.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/45-1
00:05:58.584 --> 00:06:03.693
<v thomas broussard>That technical validity,
functional validity doesn't,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/45-2
00:06:03.693 --> 00:06:06.626
<v thomas broussard>so it's up to you to find this.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/46-0
00:06:07.866 --> 00:06:12.288
<v thomas broussard>So it's not a blocker.
You can still do a join even if you don't</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/46-1
00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:17.935
<v thomas broussard>have primary key or foreign key defined,
but it's to your at your own risk because</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/46-2
00:06:17.935 --> 00:06:23.106
<v thomas broussard>it means that probably the data you are
matching are not supposed to match.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/47-0
00:06:23.426 --> 00:06:24.946
<v thomas broussard>Um, so?</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/48-0
00:06:26.906 --> 00:06:33.104
<v thomas broussard>The big question at the start of every
query is what is my primary table.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/48-1
00:06:33.104 --> 00:06:37.711
<v thomas broussard>Here we want this.
The revenue is in order other state</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/48-2
00:06:37.711 --> 00:06:42.066
<v thomas broussard>details table,
so I will select from other details.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/49-0
00:06:46.466 --> 00:06:47.026
<v thomas broussard>Who is?</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/50-0
00:06:49.466 --> 00:06:49.586
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/51-0
00:06:52.306 --> 00:06:54.946
<v thomas broussard>Then I need to do this.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/52-0
00:06:56.546 --> 00:07:03.986
<v thomas broussard>Quantity times OD dot unitrice,
which is a common factor.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/53-0
00:07:10.706 --> 00:07:10.866
<v thomas broussard>2.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/54-0
00:07:15.186 --> 00:07:21.140
<v thomas broussard>1 minus OG dot discount.
So that's the overall revenue here that</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/54-1
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.811
<v thomas broussard>we have,
especially if we do sum of this quantity,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/54-2
00:07:25.811 --> 00:07:27.826
<v thomas broussard>we sum the unit price.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/55-0
00:07:28.266 --> 00:07:32.491
<v thomas broussard>The unit, sorry,
order detail revenue and that gives me</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/55-1
00:07:32.491 --> 00:07:37.396
<v thomas broussard>the overall revenue. OK,
now we need to have a constraint on the</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/55-2
00:07:37.396 --> 00:07:43.054
<v thomas broussard>date. So this is where we need to join.
By default when you don't precise,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/55-3
00:07:43.054 --> 00:07:44.186
<v thomas broussard>it's in a join.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/56-0
00:07:44.306 --> 00:07:49.080
<v thomas broussard>OK, if you just do join like this,
it's inner join. It's preferably.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/56-1
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:54.061
<v thomas broussard>Preferably you will resize the kind of
join so that it's more readable.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/56-2
00:07:54.061 --> 00:07:55.306
<v thomas broussard>Let's join orders.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/57-0
00:07:59.906 --> 00:08:00.386

00:08:01.986 --> 00:08:07.797
<v thomas broussard>And here you see the beaver is trying to
help you from the known foreign key</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/58-1
00:08:07.797 --> 00:08:11.570
<v thomas broussard>relation.
It tries to set up the criteria so that</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/58-2
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:16.626
<v thomas broussard>it matches something that you have set up
in terms of constraints.</v>

00:08:17.146 --> 00:08:18.626

00:08:21.986 --> 00:08:29.783
<v thomas broussard>And then this is where we do a filter
where year of all dots or the date equal</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/61-1
00:08:29.783 --> 00:08:31.066
<v thomas broussard>to something.</v>

00:08:32.786 --> 00:08:38.316
<v thomas broussard>This is, let's say, the static version,
because we can have a more dynamic</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/62-1
00:08:38.316 --> 00:08:40.306

<v thomas broussard>Yeah.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/66-0
00:09:00.346 --> 00:09:06.746

00:09:09.986 --> 00:09:13.442
<v thomas broussard>OK,
remember that when you have something in</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/67-1
00:09:13.442 --> 00:09:17.358
<v thomas broussard>the group by,
it has to be in front as well of the</v>

00:09:22.546 --> 00:09:26.182
<v thomas broussard>So if you group by something here,
you should have it here as well,</v>

00:09:26.182 --> 00:09:27.626

00:09:31.346 --> 00:09:34.850
<v thomas broussard>OK,
and you see here that the name pretty</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/69-1
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:40.356
<v thomas broussard>important for the exam.
The exam you will have column that can be</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/69-2
00:09:40.356 --> 00:09:45.946
<v thomas broussard>renamed, so be careful.
I will expect the exact match if the data.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/70-0
00:09:46.266 --> 00:09:50.379
<v thomas broussard>Bonjour. If the data are matching,
that's good,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/70-1
00:09:50.379 --> 00:09:56.120
<v thomas broussard>but that's only a partial mark.
If data plus headers are matching,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/70-2
00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:01.946
<v thomas broussard>that's still a partial mark because I
need to have header contents.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/71-0
00:10:02.186 --> 00:10:09.630
<v thomas broussard>And order. If it is strictly the same,
then you have 20% bonus on the full grade</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/71-1
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:15.053
<v thomas broussard>on the full mark.
So that means that you can have up to 1.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/71-2
00:10:15.053 --> 00:10:17.626
<v thomas broussard>2 out of 1, so partial mark.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/73-0
00:10:17.666 --> 00:10:22.766
<v thomas broussard>.3 for each aspect .
3 if you have only the data .</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/73-1
00:10:22.766 --> 00:10:29.766
<v thomas broussard>3 if you have only the other .
3 if you have only the errors you see.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/73-2
00:10:29.766 --> 00:10:35.666
<v thomas broussard>So even if you don't manage to answer a
query a smart way.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/74-0
00:10:35.666 --> 00:10:42.632
<v thomas broussard>To hack the question is to at least
select the correct column names. It's .</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/74-1
00:10:42.632 --> 00:10:48.497
<v thomas broussard>3 secured for all the questions you see,
so don't remain stuck.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/74-2
00:10:48.497 --> 00:10:54.546
<v thomas broussard>You can do select the column names that
are required and no data.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/75-0
00:10:55.306 --> 00:11:00.239
<v thomas broussard>It is still valid. OK, why is that?
Because you are software engineers,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/75-1
00:11:00.239 --> 00:11:03.869
<v thomas broussard>so even if the query returns no data,
you still can.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/75-2
00:11:03.869 --> 00:11:09.007
<v thomas broussard>You are still able to use it at some
point in your application because you</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/75-3
00:11:09.007 --> 00:11:13.186
<v thomas broussard>have the right structure,
you have the right returns layout.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/76-0
00:11:13.266 --> 00:11:17.768
<v thomas broussard>So This is why I'm putting some value on
this,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/76-1
00:11:17.768 --> 00:11:24.378
<v thomas broussard>because the structure is some is a part
of the solution as well. OK,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/76-2
00:11:24.378 --> 00:11:27.826
<v thomas broussard>it's and it's strong parts, so here.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/77-0
00:11:28.946 --> 00:11:30.826
<v thomas broussard>Be careful if it is said like this.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/78-0
00:11:36.506 --> 00:11:39.626
<v thomas broussard>You have to match the exact same column
names.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/79-0
00:11:41.106 --> 00:11:45.358
<v thomas broussard>I it's strict in the exam.
If it is not matching then you you don't</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/79-1
00:11:45.358 --> 00:11:46.546
<v thomas broussard>have the full mark.</v>

00:11:48.546 --> 00:11:52.445
<v thomas broussard>OK, guys,
so this is the five and I would like you</v>

<v thomas broussard>Let me try a second.
I'm just trying to check with.</v>

00:21:15.426 --> 00:21:17.546
<v thomas broussard>Uh, yes.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/170-0
00:21:22.106 --> 00:21:28.546
<v thomas broussard>Well, OK, she can just ring me to invite.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/171-0
00:21:29.786 --> 00:21:38.586
<v thomas broussard>I think, yeah, sure.
Let's go first round of of correction.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/172-0
00:21:44.106 --> 00:21:50.563
<v thomas broussard>So list of countries covered by delivery.
So here we can do of course a select from</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/172-1
00:21:50.563 --> 00:21:56.789
<v thomas broussard>and I strongly encourage you to have this
approach to be more effective when you</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/172-2
00:21:56.789 --> 00:22:01.323
<v thomas broussard>write your query.
Do not try to put the column names first</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/172-3
00:22:01.323 --> 00:22:03.706
<v thomas broussard>because you have to select the.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/173-0
00:22:03.706 --> 00:22:07.822
<v thomas broussard>The table.
What is the first input is the table and</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/173-1
00:22:07.822 --> 00:22:14.312
<v thomas broussard>here the countries covered by delivery.
I have to think more than 10 seconds just</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/173-2
00:22:14.312 --> 00:22:18.428
<v thomas broussard>to make sure that we have selected the
right thing,</v>

00:22:18.428 --> 00:22:22.306
<v thomas broussard>so I think we can rely on the ship
country here.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/174-0
00:22:23.506 --> 00:22:28.946
<v thomas broussard>Which is in orders. So my table,
the primary table I'm fetching is orders.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/175-0
00:22:31.146 --> 00:22:35.244
<v thomas broussard>Why is that good?
Is that better to select from the table</v>

00:22:35.244 --> 00:22:38.070
<v thomas broussard>first?
Because after that you have code</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/175-2
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:41.886
<v thomas broussard>completion.
You can do all dots and then you have the</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/175-3
00:22:41.886 --> 00:22:46.266
<v thomas broussard>column names. You don't have to type them.
Yes, why? Why not?</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/176-0
00:22:47.466 --> 00:22:53.152
<v thomas broussard>It's possible for another to northern and
it's not that's in the shippers.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/176-1
00:22:53.152 --> 00:22:56.715
<v thomas broussard>We don't have anything related to the
country.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/176-2
00:22:56.715 --> 00:23:01.946
<v thomas broussard>Shippers don't join on other because
looking at the location, right?</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/177-0
00:23:02.506 --> 00:23:07.430
<v thomas broussard>It's possible that there are orders that
have not been shipped, yeah,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/177-1
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:12.284
<v thomas broussard>but the question said by delivery,
so that was not going to be over.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/177-2
00:23:12.284 --> 00:23:17.560
<v thomas broussard>It's the countries covered by delivery
means that maybe there's a a double</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/177-3
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.826
<v thomas broussard>meaning here, but.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/178-0
00:23:19.026 --> 00:23:25.826
<v thomas broussard>What is interesting is what countries can
we have been covered by delivery?</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/179-0
00:23:27.346 --> 00:23:30.186
<v thomas broussard>OK, OK, that means.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/180-0
00:23:33.146 --> 00:23:38.290
<v thomas broussard>That we need to make the list in the
orders of all the countries to where we</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/180-1
00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:39.826
<v thomas broussard>have shipped something.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/181-0
00:23:41.506 --> 00:23:41.626
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/182-0
00:23:44.306 --> 00:23:49.263
<v thomas broussard>OK, for that kind of question,
that's true that sometimes the way it is</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/182-1
00:23:49.263 --> 00:23:54.083
<v thomas broussard>formulated can be an issue,
but don't worry because you will normally</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/182-2
00:23:54.083 --> 00:23:59.866
<v thomas broussard>wish you should understand better during
the exam because you have the screenshots.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/183-0
00:24:00.306 --> 00:24:08.636
<v thomas broussard>And you have the columns to be selected,
etcetera. OK, so but in and in any case,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/183-1
00:24:08.636 --> 00:24:15.746
<v thomas broussard>I will be here to give advice. Bonjour.
Where's my coffee? My coffee?</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/184-0
00:24:16.026 --> 00:24:22.172
<v thomas broussard>You're late.
It's because you took a coffee. OK,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/184-1
00:24:22.172 --> 00:24:30.826
<v thomas broussard>that's a joke, of course,
but that's not good to be late. I said it.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/185-0
00:24:31.546 --> 00:24:31.666
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/186-0
00:24:32.706 --> 00:24:33.626
<v thomas broussard>Uh, oh, that's.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/187-0
00:24:38.826 --> 00:24:40.146
<v thomas broussard>Ship country.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/188-0
00:24:44.506 --> 00:24:50.220
<v thomas broussard>And here you have all the list.
You see that we have as many countries as</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/188-1
00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:55.084
<v thomas broussard>we have different orders,
but this is this is creating as well</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/188-2
00:24:55.084 --> 00:25:01.339
<v thomas broussard>duplicates. So this is not what we want.
If we want to have only the unique set,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/188-3
00:25:01.339 --> 00:25:03.346
<v thomas broussard>we have to place distinct.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/189-0
00:25:03.906 --> 00:25:04.506
<v thomas broussard>Visual.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/190-0
00:25:07.106 --> 00:25:12.167
<v thomas broussard>OK guys, and here I'm happy,
but I'm not so happy because when you</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/190-1
00:25:12.167 --> 00:25:17.153
<v thomas broussard>look for something you expect the list to
be organized correctly.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/190-2
00:25:17.153 --> 00:25:22.516
<v thomas broussard>Otherwise here it's very difficult.
Imagine you want to set to search.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/190-3
00:25:22.516 --> 00:25:24.706
<v thomas broussard>I don't know for for Denmark.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/191-0
00:25:25.306 --> 00:25:31.731
<v thomas broussard>You have to look 1 by 1 all the entries
and you you find it after some time,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/191-1
00:25:31.731 --> 00:25:38.573
<v thomas broussard>but hopefully that's only 21 countries.
So it's very important for your customer,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/191-2
00:25:38.573 --> 00:25:40.826
<v thomas broussard>for your users to order by.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/192-0
00:25:40.946 --> 00:25:41.586
<v thomas broussard>Something.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/193-0
00:25:42.586 --> 00:25:46.455
<v thomas broussard>Whatever,
whatever makes sense regarding the data.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/193-1
00:25:46.455 --> 00:25:49.186
<v thomas broussard>And here of course it's binary ship.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/194-0
00:25:50.906 --> 00:25:52.666
<v thomas broussard>country</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/195-0
00:25:58.786 --> 00:25:58.906
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/196-0
00:26:00.506 --> 00:26:04.826
<v thomas broussard>So here this is a kind of result you
could expect from an application.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/197-0
00:26:06.186 --> 00:26:10.326
<v thomas broussard>Please think to your user.
Think about your users.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/197-1
00:26:10.326 --> 00:26:15.358
<v thomas broussard>Think about you yourself when you use an
application. For me,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/197-2
00:26:15.358 --> 00:26:20.066
<v thomas broussard>it's upsetting when you have a list which
is not ordered.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/197-3
00:26:20.066 --> 00:26:22.826
<v thomas broussard>I can give you a very bad example.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/198-0
00:26:23.186 --> 00:26:26.946
<v thomas broussard>It's this list in teams look.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/199-0
00:26:28.386 --> 00:26:31.891
<v thomas broussard>What can you do with that?
You can do nothing.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/199-1
00:26:31.891 --> 00:26:38.006
<v thomas broussard>I have so many teams and I don't want to
close them because sometimes I have some</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/199-2
00:26:38.006 --> 00:26:43.226
<v thomas broussard>ideas that are developed only in one team,
so but it's not organized.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/200-0
00:26:44.586 --> 00:26:48.786
<v thomas broussard>I have teams from here.
I can tell you it's from 2020.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/201-0
00:26:50.626 --> 00:26:53.426
<v thomas broussard>And it's mixed with things from 2025.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/202-0
00:26:54.746 --> 00:27:04.720
<v thomas broussard>So you seem even Microsoft cannot be can
be not aware of some user experience</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/202-1
00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:10.346
<v thomas broussard>problem,
but try to to be better than that.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/203-0
00:27:11.466 --> 00:27:16.708
<v thomas broussard>List of available transporters.
So you have to map here transporters to</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/203-1
00:27:16.708 --> 00:27:21.804
<v thomas broussard>shippers actually and here we it's not
precise exactly what you want,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/203-2
00:27:21.804 --> 00:27:25.226
<v thomas broussard>so you can take everything,
select stuff from.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/204-0
00:27:27.026 --> 00:27:34.001
<v thomas broussard>Cheapers,
but still think about the other other buy.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/204-1
00:27:34.001 --> 00:27:40.186
<v thomas broussard>Uh, you see, you brought me a coffee.
Awesome.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/205-0
00:27:42.066 --> 00:27:42.226
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/206-0
00:27:46.026 --> 00:27:50.866
<v thomas broussard>OK,
so always try to organize it so that it's.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/207-0
00:27:52.866 --> 00:27:54.026
<v thomas broussard>It's readable.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/208-0
00:27:55.026 --> 00:27:55.186
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/209-0
00:27:57.466 --> 00:28:00.946
<v thomas broussard>Number of customer per countries.
What does that mean?</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/210-0
00:28:02.106 --> 00:28:02.146
<v thomas broussard>I.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/211-0
00:28:04.826 --> 00:28:14.922
<v thomas broussard>I'll ask the same result. It's not matter.
Where where do where do you need?</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/211-1
00:28:14.922 --> 00:28:21.346
<v thomas broussard>You don't need the joints actually
because here.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/212-0
00:28:21.866 --> 00:28:26.566
<v thomas broussard>Yeah,
but actually it's not necessary because</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/212-1
00:28:26.566 --> 00:28:33.411
<v thomas broussard>you don't need anything else than what is
already in the shippers.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/212-2
00:28:33.411 --> 00:28:38.826
<v thomas broussard>So when it is in that state,
you don't need to join.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/213-0
00:28:39.506 --> 00:28:44.718
<v thomas broussard>So what I'm trying to ask,
I have the same result but I don't care.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/213-1
00:28:44.718 --> 00:28:48.704
<v thomas broussard>You don't care.
OK if if the query is suboptimized,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/213-2
00:28:48.704 --> 00:28:54.146
<v thomas broussard>I don't care. I will put a timer.
The timer is 1 minute Max per query.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/214-0
00:28:55.066 --> 00:29:01.363
<v thomas broussard>It can happen with the database you have,
which is a big database that is just make</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/214-1
00:29:01.363 --> 00:29:04.961
<v thomas broussard>a query suboptimal can run for several
minutes.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/214-2
00:29:04.961 --> 00:29:10.583
<v thomas broussard>I will cut at one minute in the case if
it is interrupted, but looks good,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/214-3
00:29:10.583 --> 00:29:14.706
<v thomas broussard>looks correct.
I mean because you had the right ideas.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/215-0
00:29:14.986 --> 00:29:18.938
<v thomas broussard>Not just not optimized.
You will have a part,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/215-1
00:29:18.938 --> 00:29:25.466
<v thomas broussard>a good part of a good amount of the month.
OK, OK, maybe half of the month.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/216-0
00:29:26.426 --> 00:29:30.626
<v thomas broussard>Number of customer back countries.
Who has done this one?</v>

00:29:36.946 --> 00:29:42.116
<v thomas broussard>OK, have a look. It's customer.
It's a number per something that means</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/218-1
00:29:42.116 --> 00:29:42.626
<v thomas broussard>it's a.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/219-0
00:29:43.986 --> 00:29:44.746
<v thomas broussard>Oh, Sir.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/220-0
00:29:47.146 --> 00:29:52.722
<v thomas broussard>Number or something,
there will be a cause and it is fair,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/220-1
00:29:52.722 --> 00:29:59.809
<v thomas broussard>so it's group by. So it's group by.
So when you see that kind of sentence,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/220-2
00:29:59.809 --> 00:30:02.266
<v thomas broussard>you should see a group by.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/221-0
00:30:05.226 --> 00:30:14.466
<v thomas broussard>That's that's.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/222-0
00:30:15.666 --> 00:30:16.386
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/226-0
00:30:35.466 --> 00:30:35.546
<v thomas broussard>Um.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/229-0
00:30:59.306 --> 00:30:59.466
<v thomas broussard>Wait.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/230-0
00:31:06.986 --> 00:31:09.346
<v thomas broussard>You're having some data.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/231-0
00:31:14.866 --> 00:31:17.226
<v thomas broussard>But I think I'm serious for instance.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/232-0
00:31:19.306 --> 00:31:20.186
<v thomas broussard>That's it.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/233-0
00:31:23.946 --> 00:31:29.346
<v thomas broussard>There's nothing,
so I think you should rerun the.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/234-0
00:31:31.706 --> 00:31:33.186
<v thomas broussard>I do.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/235-0
00:31:34.706 --> 00:31:41.069
<v thomas broussard>It was OK. We're very good.
It's we're actually a little bit. OK.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/235-1
00:31:41.069 --> 00:31:47.914
<v thomas broussard>And that's the reason. Yeah.
But the Daniel hasn't even changed. Yeah.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/235-2
00:31:47.914 --> 00:31:51.866
<v thomas broussard>Yeah. So I should have made it very hard.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/236-0
00:31:52.026 --> 00:31:55.586
<v thomas broussard>Let's go keep.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/237-0
00:31:58.186 --> 00:32:04.026
<v thomas broussard>Yeah, the fact it was on paper,
it was on paper and you know the way the</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/237-1
00:32:04.026 --> 00:32:09.786
<v thomas broussard>the teacher did the full in reference of
course. Yeah, the backgrounds,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/237-2
00:32:09.786 --> 00:32:14.426
<v thomas broussard>it was very difficult. OK,
good to know if it was simple.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/238-0
00:32:18.906 --> 00:32:19.666
<v thomas broussard>You do.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/239-0
00:32:22.266 --> 00:32:37.546
<v thomas broussard>Yeah, but that's not my because.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/240-0
00:32:39.306 --> 00:32:43.893
<v thomas broussard>Yeah,
it's training and I'm here to explain in</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/240-1
00:32:43.893 --> 00:32:51.897
<v thomas broussard>the example. No, not to be standard. No,
it's essential. It's more difficult. No,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/240-2
00:32:51.897 --> 00:32:56.386
<v thomas broussard>it's a. Yeah,
so that's normally what people.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/242-0
00:32:56.826 --> 00:33:06.179
<v thomas broussard>We need to not want to say it with race,
so that we can.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/242-1
00:33:06.179 --> 00:33:11.266
<v thomas broussard>I should follow the basic exam.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/243-0
00:33:17.186 --> 00:33:17.586
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/250-0
00:34:00.786 --> 00:34:02.546
<v thomas broussard>That's what we think.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/251-0
00:34:04.386 --> 00:34:04.786
<v thomas broussard>Let's see.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/252-0
00:34:11.786 --> 00:34:12.066
<v thomas broussard>S.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/257-0
00:34:38.986 --> 00:34:45.300
<v thomas broussard>So this one you also have to like, um,
order them, depending on order.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/257-1
00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:48.946
<v thomas broussard>Maybe I'm going to talk today in another.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/258-0
00:34:54.066 --> 00:34:59.553
<v thomas broussard>Yeah,
because I've seen countries with not.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/258-1
00:34:59.553 --> 00:35:06.287
<v thomas broussard>I don't see,
I don't think there's a country with not</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/258-2
00:35:06.287 --> 00:35:08.906
<v thomas broussard>graduating. We do so.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/259-0
00:35:10.986 --> 00:35:17.136
<v thomas broussard>Yes, normally. OK, you have two ways.
Number of customer per countries.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/259-1
00:35:17.136 --> 00:35:21.834
<v thomas broussard>Either you can't,
you're organized by counts or you're</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/259-2
00:35:21.834 --> 00:35:27.386
<v thomas broussard>organized by name. OK,
depends actually the context if you want.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/260-0
00:35:27.386 --> 00:35:32.204
<v thomas broussard>So you don't know what you are looking
for. Maybe organizing by name is good.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/260-1
00:35:32.204 --> 00:35:36.836
<v thomas broussard>If you know that you want to see the top
countries or something like this,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/260-2
00:35:36.836 --> 00:35:39.306
<v thomas broussard>it's better to organize by class module.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/261-0
00:35:44.426 --> 00:35:50.140
<v thomas broussard>So as usual,
select from and then the table name.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/261-1
00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:53.226
<v thomas broussard>We want here the customers.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/262-0
00:35:56.026 --> 00:35:59.342
<v thomas broussard>OK,
and then you have access to the code</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/262-1
00:35:59.342 --> 00:36:03.386
<v thomas broussard>completion.
It's only a recommendation guys, huh?</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/263-0
00:36:09.746 --> 00:36:16.126
<v thomas broussard>So here you want to have whatever because
it's a count and you have to have the</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/263-1
00:36:16.126 --> 00:36:20.113
<v thomas broussard>country,
so the country and C dot customer ID for</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/263-2
00:36:20.113 --> 00:36:22.266
<v thomas broussard>instance the count of this.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/264-0
00:36:31.346 --> 00:36:31.586
<v thomas broussard>Groove by.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/265-0
00:36:35.066 --> 00:36:36.746
<v thomas broussard>Council.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/266-0
00:36:39.186 --> 00:36:43.811
<v thomas broussard>Why is the same? Because there's.
Why is that the same?</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/266-1
00:36:43.811 --> 00:36:48.601
<v thomas broussard>What should it be the same?
Because I hear we don't care.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/266-2
00:36:48.601 --> 00:36:53.226
<v thomas broussard>It would be stars work. You can't.
You can't the rules.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/267-0
00:36:53.266 --> 00:36:58.685
<v thomas broussard>You don't count the column. OK, OK,
you count the rows and normally there's</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/267-1
00:36:58.685 --> 00:37:02.820
<v thomas broussard>on in one row.
You have only one instance of each column.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/267-2
00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:08.666
<v thomas broussard>So it's you see it's one row equals one
column. In terms of count, it's the same.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/268-0
00:37:08.866 --> 00:37:15.326
<v thomas broussard>So you can do this even the first column,
the second column providing you have at</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/268-1
00:37:15.326 --> 00:37:19.186
<v thomas broussard>least two columns, et cetera.
So you don't care.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/269-0
00:37:20.466 --> 00:37:25.226
<v thomas broussard>And here of course, if I do that,
I will miss the order by.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/270-0
00:37:26.386 --> 00:37:28.826
<v thomas broussard>And here maybe I can just do CNT.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/271-0
00:37:33.066 --> 00:37:37.466
<v thomas broussard>OK, so this is CNT ascending,
CNT descending.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/272-0
00:37:40.266 --> 00:37:46.146
<v thomas broussard>OK, wait, you can put whatever you want.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/273-0
00:37:47.666 --> 00:37:51.466
<v thomas broussard>Since it is from the customer table, yeah.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/274-0
00:37:53.666 --> 00:37:56.706
<v thomas broussard>Number of orders which are ordered but
not shipped</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/275-0
00:38:03.026 --> 00:38:03.146
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/276-0
00:38:12.266 --> 00:38:13.866
<v thomas broussard>OK. Thank you.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/279-0
00:38:25.186 --> 00:38:25.386
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/280-0
00:38:33.106 --> 00:38:33.626
<v thomas broussard>No, no.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/281-0
00:38:34.786 --> 00:38:39.023
<v thomas broussard>The question is within the orders,
what does that mean?</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/281-1
00:38:39.023 --> 00:38:45.075
<v thomas broussard>Ordered but not shipped actually and we
can we should have a look to the orders</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/281-2
00:38:45.075 --> 00:38:50.900
<v thomas broussard>table because this is where starts the
question and so we can have to have a</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/281-3
00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:52.186
<v thomas broussard>look to the data.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/282-0
00:38:58.306 --> 00:39:03.146
<v thomas broussard>And if we have a look here to the dates.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/283-0
00:39:06.106 --> 00:39:11.906
<v thomas broussard>OK, we have all the dates, required dates.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/284-0
00:39:12.946 --> 00:39:16.626
<v thomas broussard>That's fine. It's weird.
I would have expected so.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/285-0
00:39:24.106 --> 00:39:24.346
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/287-0
00:39:36.506 --> 00:39:38.506
<v thomas broussard>OK, we see here at the ends.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/288-0
00:39:39.986 --> 00:39:46.346
<v thomas broussard>That we have some orders where we have
not shipped date, so we have null values.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/289-0
00:39:47.426 --> 00:39:53.499
<v thomas broussard>Which means that those orders have been
ordered, but they have not been delivered,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/289-1
00:39:53.499 --> 00:39:58.548
<v thomas broussard>they have not been shipped.
So sometimes it is called painful orders</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/289-2
00:39:58.548 --> 00:40:02.719
<v thomas broussard>or stuck orders, actually,
because they have been stuck,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/289-3
00:40:02.719 --> 00:40:05.426
<v thomas broussard>they have been ordered, but not sent.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/290-0
00:40:05.706 --> 00:40:07.426

01:01:47.906 --> 01:01:48.186
<v thomas broussard>What?</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/497-0

01:01:57.186 --> 01:02:02.613
<v thomas broussard>So let's go back to here.
The most expensive products that actually</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/499-1
01:02:02.613 --> 01:02:07.162
<v thomas broussard>means nothing.
Maybe we should rephrase this question to</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/499-2
01:02:07.162 --> 01:02:13.386
<v thomas broussard>the products ordered by their price,
their unit price, because we don't know.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/500-0
01:02:13.706 --> 01:02:18.442
<v thomas broussard>But it's an expensive product.
We don't know if it is because you you</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/500-1
01:02:18.442 --> 01:02:23.651
<v thomas broussard>may have noticed that in the products we
have as well a quantity per product</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/500-2
01:02:23.651 --> 01:02:28.386
<v thomas broussard>because it's the the condition of each
product is a bit different so.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/501-0
01:02:29.386 --> 01:02:34.196
<v thomas broussard>For instance,
the most expensive product is a French</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/501-1
01:02:34.196 --> 01:02:38.823
<v thomas broussard>wine here,
but you have 12 bottles bottles inside,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/501-2
01:02:38.823 --> 01:02:44.268
<v thomas broussard>so it's expensive,
but this is because you have 12 packs of</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/501-3
01:02:44.268 --> 01:02:45.266
<v thomas broussard>12 bottles.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/502-0
01:02:46.146 --> 01:02:50.546
<v thomas broussard>Let's organize by unit price ordered by
descending.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/503-0
01:02:51.706 --> 01:02:57.826
<v thomas broussard>So select from products B.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/504-0

01:03:04.826 --> 01:03:05.946
<v thomas broussard>He does.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/507-0
01:03:08.106 --> 01:03:09.266
<v thomas broussard>You need price.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/508-0
01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:13.066
<v thomas broussard>And this and.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/509-0
01:03:15.146 --> 01:03:30.146
<v thomas broussard>And code is French wine and you have sure
products so.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/510-0
01:03:30.506 --> 01:03:37.496
<v thomas broussard>It's here it's it's true that it is vague.
In the exam you will have a limit.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/510-1
01:03:37.496 --> 01:03:44.306
<v thomas broussard>You will have let's say 5 return 5
results or 10 results and that's it. OK.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/511-0
01:03:46.026 --> 01:03:51.269
<v thomas broussard>You will use limits to get only the five
top most expensive,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/511-1
01:03:51.269 --> 01:03:58.146
<v thomas broussard>except if you are asked to use the rank.
You remember the rank function that we</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/511-2
01:03:58.146 --> 01:04:01.928
<v thomas broussard>used.
So if it is stated exactly to use the</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/511-3
01:04:01.928 --> 01:04:04.506
<v thomas broussard>rank then you have to do that.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/512-0
01:04:04.746 --> 01:04:07.426

<v thomas broussard>So select star from products.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/514-0
01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:22.106

01:04:23.066 --> 01:04:24.026
<v thomas broussard>How do I know that?</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/516-0
01:04:28.066 --> 01:04:31.898
<v thomas broussard>Yeah,
but discontinued this one is usually the</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/516-1
01:04:31.898 --> 01:04:37.768

01:04:37.768 --> 01:04:42.986
<v thomas broussard>engines back from the 90s.
Boolean was not existing, it was 01.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/517-0
01:04:43.066 --> 01:04:49.170

01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:57.786
<v thomas broussard>I will add per category name that is
important because it will provoke.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/518-0
01:04:58.346 --> 01:05:00.946

01:06:25.586 --> 01:06:25.746
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

01:06:30.506 --> 01:06:36.873
<v thomas broussard>So how do we do that?
From what table are we starting?</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/531-1
01:06:36.873 --> 01:06:45.671
<v thomas broussard>Ohh From what table are we starting?
Category? No. Products? What you want?</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/531-2
01:06:45.671 --> 01:06:50.186
<v thomas broussard>What do you want to count? Products and</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/532-0
01:06:50.346 --> 01:06:52.866
<v thomas broussard>The rest is only like formatting, okay?</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/533-0
01:06:54.506 --> 01:06:59.280
<v thomas broussard>Be careful the the main idea.
The main concept here is product.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/533-1
01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:04.277
<v thomas broussard>It is what you want to have.
Can you do without the category? Yes,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/533-2
01:07:04.277 --> 01:07:07.186
<v thomas broussard>you could. You could count the product.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/534-0
01:07:08.666 --> 01:07:13.135
<v thomas broussard>You see and and and here if you look at
the products,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/534-1
01:07:13.135 --> 01:07:18.928
<v thomas broussard>you still have a category ID.
The category name is something that you</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/534-2
01:07:18.928 --> 01:07:23.066
<v thomas broussard>have to add later. OK,
so pay attention identify.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/535-0
01:07:24.026 --> 01:07:29.345
<v thomas broussard>The primary table the where from where
you want to extract the data.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/535-1
01:07:29.345 --> 01:07:35.666
<v thomas broussard>So what is important here is the count
from product, so select star from product.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/536-0
01:07:40.386 --> 01:07:43.626
<v thomas broussard>OK, but here there's.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/537-0
01:07:47.066 --> 01:07:50.466
<v thomas broussard>I think I will own an iPhone very soon.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/538-0
01:07:52.186 --> 01:07:54.066
<v thomas broussard>I will capture it.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/539-0
01:07:58.586 --> 01:08:04.438
<v thomas broussard>Counts of and then I can sell this iPhone
and buy two Android phones for the same</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/539-1
01:08:04.438 --> 01:08:04.866
<v thomas broussard>price.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/540-0
01:08:09.266 --> 01:08:15.826
<v thomas broussard>Um, counts of product by category name.
So here it's a counts pair.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/541-0
01:08:17.346 --> 01:08:18.946
<v thomas broussard>Something so it's so.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/542-0
01:08:21.066 --> 01:08:24.648
<v thomas broussard>Group by,
it's a group by and as it is a group by,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/542-1
01:08:24.648 --> 01:08:29.775
<v thomas broussard>it means that we'll have a counts of
course, and we'll have a row title.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/542-2
01:08:29.775 --> 01:08:35.254
<v thomas broussard>You remember that concept of row title
that will be the category name in that</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/542-3
01:08:35.254 --> 01:08:38.906
<v thomas broussard>case because we want to organize per
category name.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/543-0
01:08:39.626 --> 01:08:45.039
<v thomas broussard>So here we cannot have category name
because it's in the categories table.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/543-1
01:08:45.039 --> 01:08:49.586
<v thomas broussard>So we need to left drawing because we
want to. Why do we want?</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/544-0
01:08:51.066 --> 01:08:53.506
<v thomas broussard>That's interesting here.
Why do we want to left join?</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/545-0
01:08:56.146 --> 01:09:02.519
<v thomas broussard>Because we want to count all the products,
imagine that there's no corresponding</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/545-1
01:09:02.519 --> 01:09:08.026
<v thomas broussard>category in the categories table.
We still want to have the category,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/545-2
01:09:08.026 --> 01:09:13.690
<v thomas broussard>the product counts. You see,
even if the category ID points to nothing.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/545-3
01:09:13.690 --> 01:09:15.106
<v thomas broussard>So This is why we.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/546-0
01:09:15.706 --> 01:09:19.919
<v thomas broussard>use a left join.
Pay attention because if we use an inner</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/546-1
01:09:19.919 --> 01:09:23.333
<v thomas broussard>join,
we'll skip some products because we will</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/546-2
01:09:23.333 --> 01:09:27.982
<v thomas broussard>keep only the ones that are um fully
connected to the category.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/546-3
01:09:27.982 --> 01:09:33.866
<v thomas broussard>So this is why usually we want the left
join and not the inner join to not skip.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/547-0
01:09:33.946 --> 01:09:41.226
<v thomas broussard>Any data we want to know when there are
unconnected data left join categories.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/548-0
01:09:42.506 --> 01:09:49.684
<v thomas broussard>On and there's a link between category
and products, categories and product.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/548-1
01:09:49.684 --> 01:09:52.946
<v thomas broussard>So here we will use P dot category.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/549-0
01:09:54.346 --> 01:09:57.306
<v thomas broussard>Uh, sorry, C dot category name.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/550-0
01:09:58.826 --> 01:09:59.106
<v thomas broussard>Comes.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/551-0
01:10:01.466 --> 01:10:11.786
<v thomas broussard>And this because we have not used group
by here group by category name.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/552-0
01:10:17.266 --> 01:10:20.266
<v thomas broussard>Be careful because here if we group by
category name.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/553-0
01:10:22.066 --> 01:10:29.369
<v thomas broussard>What can happen is that we have
duplicates of categories and in that case</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/553-1
01:10:29.369 --> 01:10:37.066
<v thomas broussard>we create here the false results because
imagine that we have two categories.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/554-0
01:10:38.026 --> 01:10:39.026
<v thomas broussard>Called Beverages.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/555-0
01:10:40.426 --> 01:10:45.161
<v thomas broussard>OK, it's it's not bad.
I mean in the end for the user the result</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/555-1
01:10:45.161 --> 01:10:49.532
<v thomas broussard>will be the same.
But what I mean is that you can have here</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/555-2
01:10:49.532 --> 01:10:55.506
<v thomas broussard>a difference between the category name
because category name is maybe not unique.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/556-0
01:10:57.106 --> 01:11:02.637
<v thomas broussard>So maybe it would be interesting to group
by category ID. In addition,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/556-1
01:11:02.637 --> 01:11:07.779
<v thomas broussard>just to be sure, as a software developer,
as a software engineer,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/556-2
01:11:07.779 --> 01:11:11.986
<v thomas broussard>what you will do usually is to include
the ID always.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/557-0
01:11:12.026 --> 01:11:17.080
<v thomas broussard>Whenever you do something,
you include the ID because this will be</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/557-1
01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:21.304
<v thomas broussard>your reference.
As soon as the user clicks somewhere on</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/557-2
01:11:21.304 --> 01:11:26.056
<v thomas broussard>your user interface,
you will need this whatever ID to contact</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/557-3
01:11:26.056 --> 01:11:27.036
<v thomas broussard>the database.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/558-0
01:11:28.316 --> 01:11:32.356
<v thomas broussard>OK, so group by category ID.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/560-0
01:11:33.316 --> 01:11:39.716
<v thomas broussard>What's the issue here? Crew by.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/561-0
01:11:45.756 --> 01:11:49.356
<v thomas broussard>What's the issue? Sorry.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/562-0
01:11:50.596 --> 01:11:56.067
<v thomas broussard>There's no issue.
And of course we need to order by order</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/562-1
01:11:56.067 --> 01:11:56.916
<v thomas broussard>by C dot.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/563-0
01:11:58.036 --> 01:12:00.596
<v thomas broussard>Category name all icons.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/564-0
01:12:01.636 --> 01:12:02.076
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/566-0
01:12:10.996 --> 01:12:13.756
<v thomas broussard>Uh, remember that we need to have this.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/567-0
01:12:15.076 --> 01:12:20.052
<v thomas broussard>That's interesting here. For instance,
if we want to have the the top three</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/567-1
01:12:20.052 --> 01:12:23.523
<v thomas broussard>categories in terms of product
representation, yeah,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/567-2
01:12:23.523 --> 01:12:26.076
<v thomas broussard>that could be a good case for the rank.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/568-0
01:12:27.636 --> 01:12:35.756
<v thomas broussard>Because we have a tie here for the the
the 2-3 and four position in this result.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/569-0
01:12:38.596 --> 01:12:40.316
<v thomas broussard>Seems good.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/570-0
01:12:41.636 --> 01:12:43.356
<v thomas broussard>Average auto price? That's tricky.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/571-0
01:12:47.116 --> 01:12:48.556
<v thomas broussard>That's tricky here.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/572-0
01:12:49.796 --> 01:12:55.470
<v thomas broussard>because this is we have computed
something related to our revenue.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/572-1
01:12:55.470 --> 01:12:59.704
<v thomas broussard>But yeah,
it's not exactly the the same approach,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/572-2
01:12:59.704 --> 01:13:06.563
<v thomas broussard>because in the revenue we can sum all the
items that we have that customers have</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/572-3
01:13:06.563 --> 01:13:07.156
<v thomas broussard>bought.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/573-0
01:13:07.156 --> 01:13:12.446
<v thomas broussard>And that creates the revenue.
Now imagine we want to compute the</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/573-1
01:13:12.446 --> 01:13:17.247
<v thomas broussard>average order price.
An order is composed of several other</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/573-2
01:13:17.247 --> 01:13:21.560
<v thomas broussard>details. OK,
it's not the same as the average of all</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/573-3
01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:23.676
<v thomas broussard>the other details revenue.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/574-0
01:13:24.516 --> 01:13:25.396
<v thomas broussard>Persed a punch.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/575-0
01:13:27.276 --> 01:13:32.655
<v thomas broussard>When I say price here,
it's not price actually revenue I would</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/575-1
01:13:32.655 --> 01:13:32.996
<v thomas broussard>say.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/576-0
01:13:37.796 --> 01:13:41.356
<v thomas broussard>I will change it from price to generated
revenue.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/580-0
01:14:00.556 --> 01:14:01.276
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/589-0
01:14:52.516 --> 01:14:52.796
<v thomas broussard>Yeah.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/590-0
01:14:56.436 --> 01:15:02.396
<v thomas broussard>It's average order generates the revenue.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/591-0
01:15:03.756 --> 01:15:05.756
<v thomas broussard>I just changed.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/592-0
01:15:10.276 --> 01:15:10.916
<v thomas broussard>Yeah.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/598-0
01:15:39.676 --> 01:15:39.916
<v thomas broussard>So.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/599-0
01:15:51.076 --> 01:15:51.196
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/600-0
01:15:53.596 --> 01:15:53.836
<v thomas broussard>8.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/611-0
01:16:51.396 --> 01:16:51.516
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/612-0
01:17:01.036 --> 01:17:01.156
<v thomas broussard>OK.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/613-0
01:17:12.316 --> 01:17:16.660
<v thomas broussard>OK. So what does that mean here?
Imagine you are doing,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/613-1
01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:22.244
<v thomas broussard>what's the difference between, OK,
let's do the the the reasoning as we</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/613-2
01:17:22.244 --> 01:17:27.596
<v thomas broussard>could do from the beginning.
Let's have a look. The revenue is here.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/614-0
01:17:29.436 --> 01:17:37.036
<v thomas broussard>O If I want to have the average revenue,
I could have the idea to take this and</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/614-1
01:17:37.036 --> 01:17:39.316
<v thomas broussard>instead of um, I do AVG.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/615-0
01:17:40.276 --> 01:17:45.392
<v thomas broussard>But the problem is that it counts the
average order details revenue.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/615-1
01:17:45.392 --> 01:17:49.766
<v thomas broussard>Now in each order we can have one, two,
three, four, five,</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/615-2
01:17:49.766 --> 01:17:53.325
<v thomas broussard>ten other details attached to one single
order.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/615-3
01:17:53.325 --> 01:17:57.996
<v thomas broussard>So that's not the same to do the average
of the order details.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/616-0
01:17:58.196 --> 01:18:01.236
<v thomas broussard>Than to do the average of the orders,
right?</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/617-0
01:18:04.076 --> 01:18:10.082
<v thomas broussard>Imagine you buy three things on Amazon
and your colleague is buying 10 things on</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/617-1
01:18:10.082 --> 01:18:13.270
<v thomas broussard>Amazon.
The other price would be the other</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/617-2
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:19.276
<v thomas broussard>generated revenue would be different for
Amazon. Of course it's not the same of.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/618-0
01:18:19.636 --> 01:18:25.529
<v thomas broussard>Averaging all the other details
independently of whom is doing the order</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/618-1
01:18:25.529 --> 01:18:31.098
<v thomas broussard>than to do to take your order,
his order and do the average for each</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/618-2
01:18:31.098 --> 01:18:33.116
<v thomas broussard>order. You see the point.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/619-0
01:18:35.276 --> 01:18:40.296
<v thomas broussard>Because the number of products and the
type of products will be of course</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/619-1
01:18:40.296 --> 01:18:44.570
<v thomas broussard>different from one other to another.
So we cannot do that way.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/619-2
01:18:44.570 --> 01:18:48.436
<v thomas broussard>So we need to 1st isolate the orders.
How do we do that?</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/620-0
01:18:56.436 --> 01:19:01.980
<v thomas broussard>What would be your logic?
We need to isolate per order. Per order.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/620-1
01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:02.476

01:19:11.956 --> 01:19:19.316
<v thomas broussard>Group by group by order.
We need to have some data groups by order.</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/624-0
01:19:20.996 --> 01:19:21.996
<v thomas broussard>You see?</v>

79dc5283-bced-4ec1-a3bd-5424ca0b977f/625-0
01:19:26.476 --> 01:19:26.756

01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:32.120
<v thomas broussard>We need to fetch from other details

01:19:39.676 --> 01:19:41.676
<v thomas broussard>So let's do select.</v>

01:20:12.156 --> 01:20:16.196
